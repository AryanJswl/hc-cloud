<p>In todays topic we will discuss&nbsp;<strong>Drone technology uses and applications.</strong> Drones also known by the name Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Miniature Pilotless Aircraft or Flying Mini&nbsp;<strong>Roborts</strong>. Over the past few years drones demand is booming in market and is used for differenet industries. From quicky deliveries at rush hour to the unreachable military basecamp drones are proving extreamly usefull in places where man cannot reach. You can also learn through my new blogs the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/how-do-drones-work/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working of drones</span></strong>&nbsp;</a>and its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bit.ly/2Uzhsz0" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working without GPS</span></strong></a>.</p>



<p>Initially known for military use, drones are now being used by individual enterpreneurs. According to a study by the year 2020, 16 million drones will be sold in commercial markets of the world below you can see the&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drone technology uses and applications</strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aerial Photography</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are use to capture footage that would otherwise requires expensive choppers. No need of pilot. Easy to reach at anyplace small and compact in size which let it take magnifying pictures by getting close to the place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shipping and Delivery</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use for fast delivery of food, small packages, medicines, beverages, letters for smaller distance. Many companies like Amazon, UPS are in favour of using drones for shot disctance delivery it will save time a lot of man power, unecessary road traffic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disaster Management</strong></h2>



<p>Drones provide a quick report after a natural or man-made disaster geather information of injured people or the total distruction. Rescue people and provide them food, water etc.You can take a example of corona virus spread in china now they provide food and water to victams through drones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Geographic Mapping</strong></h2>



<p>Drones can acquire very high-resolution data and download imagery in difficult to reach locations like coastlines, mountain tops, and islands. They are also used to create 3D maps and contribute to crowd sourced mapping applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Agriculture</strong></h2>



<p>Drones use infrared sensors to detact the crop health, enable farmers to improve crop. This is a cheap and effective method for farmers to input fertilizers and pesticides.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weather Forecast</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use to forecast weather it can monitore unpredictable weather, Since they are cheap and unmanned, drones can be sent into hurricanes and tornados, so that scientists and weather forecasters acquire new insights into their behavior.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Military</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are used by military for reaching terrorist campgrounds and use in war as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p>After knowing so much about drone application you must be curious to know how you can learn this technology and build your career. <strong>HawksCode Software Pvt Ltd</strong> come up with a idea of <strong>Easyshiksha</strong> Program where you learn about these technology online. You just need a system with internet and can learn about all these trending tech.</p>

<p>Medical robots to the rescue in the battle against Covid 19. The Covid-19 pandemic may have brought the world to a standstill, but scientists and innovators are leaving no stone unturned to aid those who are at the forefront of this fight. Countries around the world are looking at all sorts of technologies to aid the long battle against the deadly coronavirus.</p>



<p> The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/coronavirus-robot-dog-enforces-social-distancing-singapore-park/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robot</span></strong></a> can record all activities using its in-built 3D and HD cameras, and also enables doctors and nurses to interact with patients remotely, even aiding communication between patients and their family members via a 10-inch screen. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Humanoid</span></strong></a> ELF has at least 60 sensors and runs on a battery that can last up to eight hours, with an auto-charge feature. “Milagrow is very happy to support AIIMS in its fight against the pandemic and will work closely to develop more products based on the feedback. As the outbreak continues to rise alarmingly, the robots will help check the virus spread and protect doctors, nurses and caregivers from getting infected,” Rajeev Karwal, founder and chairman, Milagrow, said.</p>



<p><ins></ins></p>



<p>Additionally, AIIMS Delhi will also deploy Milagrow iMap 9, a floor-cleaning robot that can move independently and sanitise floors without human intervention. The robot uses a sodium hypochlorite solution to kill any Covid-19 spores on floor surfaces. Milagrow’s patented Real-Time Terrain Recognition Technology (RT2RT) scans all 360-degree angles and does it six times per second to make a floor map in real-time. This enables the iMap 9 to perform successfully in the first attempt as opposed to other robots which take twice or thrice the amount of time.</p>



<p>AIIMS is not the only hospital, however, where robotics are being used. A Jaipur hospital is reportedly in talks with many robotics companies for a robot that can deliver medicines and food to patients in isolation wards. The district Covid-19 centre in Ancharakkandi in Kerala’s Kannur has also deployed robots to assist health workers in caring for patients. Named Nightingale-19, the robot has been designed by students of Vimal Jyoti Engineering College in Chemberi, Kannur, and can carry food and water weighing up to 25 kg at a time. It can be controlled from a distance of 1 km.</p>



<p>Futuristic technology, combined with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/impact-of-ai-on-our-daily-life/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence</span></strong></a>, is helping scientists and health workers identify the symptoms of coronavirus, find new treatments and track its spread across the world.</p>
