<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>

<p>In today’s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Reading the ebullient reports, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives. And admittedly, it’s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so “there” you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we’re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.</span></a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All technologies come with risks</strong></h2>



<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it’s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It’s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don’t just enrich those who create them.</p>



<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robotics</span></a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/what-is-internet-of-things/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;– three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we rethink risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab</strong>, we’re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it’s the individuals, communities and organizations – the constituents – who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.</p>

<p>Top 5 Websites for Learning JavaScript. JavaScript or JS is a high-level programming language, developed by Brendan Eich of Ecma International thus also known as ECMAScript in 1995 and is considered as one of the core technologies (others being HTML and CSS) essential for the World Wide Web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This language helps in making web pages <strong>interactive</strong> and <strong>dynamic </strong>which makes it essential addition among web applications. Nowadays, almost every website and <strong>web applications</strong> use JavaScript and almost every web browser has a dedicated JavaScript engine embedded in them. Though, initially intended for the purpose for improving web applications its vast properties were explored and then, later on, people recognised if we could embed it into host software then it could be used for many purposes server-side programming in web servers, databases, in word processors etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1) Pluralsight</h2>



<p>This is an evolving learning platform which provides users with various web technologies and the software powering the internet. It consists of a very large community which not only helps but motivates you to learn more and implement something that can help the future. Not only this but also they help in the provision of information for the development of projects in the open along with the knowledge of all Mozilla’s project and how can you contribute to them.Top 5 Websites for Learning JavaScript.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2) Easyshiksha</h2>



<p>Easyshiksha is a learning platform where you can find videos related to n number of technologies. You can get a certificate and diploma from national and international Universities. Easyshiksha offer the JavaScript course in which you will learn from the scratch about JavaScript basics ES6, regular expressions and debugging.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3) Code Academy</h2>



<p>Founded by Zach Sims and Ryan Bubinski in 2011, it is an online premium free website which provides courses especially for 12 programming languages along with HTML and CSS. The languages included are Ruby, Python, and JavaScript etc. The site provides free coding classes and videos. If one pays some specified then one can get live projects, expert’s advice and many more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4) W3Schools</h2>



<p>Owned by Refnes Data launched in the year 1998, W3Schools is a popular website for the purpose of learning web technologies online. Its tutorials include written contents for understanding and then onsite implementation using its own ‘try it yourself’ tool. Some of the technologies whose tutorials can be found here are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, PHP, Node.js, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5) Hackr.io</h2>



<p>Founded by Sourabh Hooda and Gaurav Gupta, Hackr.io is an education website which rather than providing its own content about various programming and designing aspects as well as some more contents. It aggregated best tutorials from the internet based on user review and content and brought them on a single place, so that one does not have search a lot in the net and will get every course and tutorial in one place thus, saving a lot of time which was the intention of the founders as they also faced the same problem when they were learning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Introduction to D3.js for data visualization. D3.js is a JavaScript library used to manipulate documents based on data. It uses HTML, CSS, and SVG to create visual representations of data which can be viewed on any modern browser. it is a&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;tool.</p>



<p>Create a folder named&nbsp;<strong>d3js_projects</strong>. Create an HTML file in the folder named&nbsp;<strong>project_1.html</strong>.&nbsp; You can also learn about&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/">Easyshiksha Certification</a></strong></p>



<p>create a simple html web page</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;title&gt;My first page&lt;/title&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;body&gt; Web Page&lt;/body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>after this just setup D3.js with this code in head element. Rember one thing script code will be written in head elament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;script&nbsp;type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&nbsp;src=&#8221;d3.v2.min.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="310" height="163" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5563" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png 310w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After this setup the source</strong></h2>



<p>To test our D3.js setup we open the inspect element tool kit.</p>



<p>In the element tab of webkit Inspector, we open all of the elements so that we can see the whole HTML structure.&nbsp;we then hover over the d3.vs.min.js src.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOM Section</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;Using D3.js, we can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), meaning we can select elements and apply various transformations on the data visualization.</p>



<p><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;Learn D3 in 5 minutes&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Today is a beautiful day!!&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;script src='https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;<br>d3.select('h3').style('color', 'darkblue');<br>d3.select('h3').style('font-size', '24px');&lt;/script&gt;<br><br></code></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">select method is used to make manupulations and or add data in a element.</h2>



<p>So we’re simply chaining the&nbsp;<code>select()</code>&nbsp;method on the&nbsp;<code>d3</code>&nbsp;object, and then following up with&nbsp;<code>style()</code>. The first parameter dictates what we want to change and the second gives the value. Here’s the result:</p>



<p>The next concept you’ll need to learn is data binding, as that’s one of the coolest features of D3. Using it, we can populate or manipulate DOM elements in real-time. Introduction to D3.js for data visualization</p>



<p>In our HTML, we have a simple unordered list&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>ul&gt;:&nbsp; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>



<p>We want to create the list elements using a data object. Here’s the code for doing exactly that:</p>



<p>&lt;script&gt;</p>



<p>var languages=[&#8216;java&#8217;, &#8216;python&#8217;, &#8216;javascript&#8217;, &#8216;c++&#8217;];</p>



<p>d3.select(&#8220;ul&#8221;) //firstly we will select the ul</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp; .selectAll(&#8220;li&#8221;) //now we are selecting all the data is li as a array. but li is no present in code</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp;.data(languages) //language is the array passed in data it will run up to 4 times</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; .enter() // enter will check if li is present or not</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;.append(&#8220;li&#8221;) // with append we will add li</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"> .text(function(d){return d;});&nbsp;</h5>



<p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about the how to create wireframes for your application. Wireframes are the base of any application. </p>



<p>Regardless of how excellent your idea for a&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;is, if you don’t know where to start and how to go about it, it will fail. Our consistent response to such confusion is – wireframe!</p>



<p style="font-size:0"><strong><span style="color:#27aae2" class="has-inline-color">Wireframing</span></strong> is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on the way client want to see your application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Wireframe Show?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, it’s a two-dimensional skeleton of what your future mobile app will look like. It shows:</p>



<ul><li>Content prioritization</li><li>Space distribution</li><li>Intended actions</li><li>Available features and functions</li><li>Transitions between screens</li></ul>



<p><strong>Wireframes</strong> can drawn on paper, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your <strong>website or product</strong>. In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:</p>



<ul><li>Wireframe &gt; Interactive Prototype &gt; Visual &gt; Design</li><li>Sketch &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Hi-Def Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Integral Aspects of a Website</h2>



<p>In the beginning focus on integral aspects of a website. Firstly don’t even consider the design aesthetics for now. The colors, themes, fonts, and images can be taken care of later.</p>



<p>You must have a clear understanding of the features you need in your final product.&nbsp;Prepare a list and include all the things you actually need in your app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to aim at excellent user experience with your app. What’s the first thing users will see after launching your app? How will this screen guide them for further navigation? How can users take specific actions? Is it going to be easier for them to figure out?</p>



<p>UX can be abstract and complicated. Because, just like everything else on the Internet, the UX is also evolving at a tremendous pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now you are ready to start putting these ideas down. </h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to use pen and paper to start designing your UX, UI when there are tonnes of applications available in the market which that you can easy build one for you. </p>



<p>Now before ending this I want to share some tools name that can be very useful for building wireframes.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><strong>Balsmiq</strong>, <strong>draw.io</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>, <strong>Figma</strong> are the free tools available online. You can easily start working on these start putting your ideas and start building your application.</p>

<p>In this blog, I am going to talk about the&nbsp;<strong>reasons why your business should use Podcasting.</strong>Podcasting has garnered an immense popularity over the years. A&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;is a set of digital audio files that are available on the internet for downloading. A user can subscribe to the podcast to receive the digital files once they are uploaded.</p>



<p>Businesses nowadays are increasingly using podcasts to improve their prospects. It is a powerful marketing tool. Podcasts have become the new talk radio on mobile devices. In fact, the increased usage of mobile phones has led to the explosive growth of podcasting.</p>



<p>“If you’re a business in an industry that has a high customer value, then a podcast may be one of your most effective education and marketing tools,” says Spencer Shaw, founder of the podcast production firm<strong>PodKick Media.</strong></p>



<p>More than one-third (39%) of owners of SMBs listen to podcasts, and 65% listen at least weekly,&nbsp;according to a survey by small business research firm Bredin. Listenership increases with company size, found that 70-72% of owners of businesses with 100 to 500 employees are tuning in.</p>



<p>You can’t demonstrate your credibility without sharing your expertise, and by sharing your expertise you become helpful. You become valuable for your listeners,” explains Stephen Woessner on his podcast&nbsp;Onward Nation, a daily podcast for business owners.</p>
