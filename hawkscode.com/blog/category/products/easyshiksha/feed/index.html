<p>In today’s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Reading the ebullient reports, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives. And admittedly, it’s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so “there” you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we’re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.</span></a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All technologies come with risks</strong></h2>



<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it’s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It’s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don’t just enrich those who create them.</p>



<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robotics</span></a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/what-is-internet-of-things/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;– three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we rethink risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab</strong>, we’re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it’s the individuals, communities and organizations – the constituents – who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.</p>

<p>In this blog, I am going to talk about some&nbsp;<strong><strong>amazing data sources for data visualization</strong></strong>.&nbsp;<strong><strong>Data visualization</strong></strong>&nbsp;is one of the core skills in&nbsp;<strong><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://easyshiksha.com/Post%20Graduate%20Program%20in%20Data%20Science%20%E2%80%93%20Visualization%20Spzln" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">data science</span></a></strong></strong>. To start building useful models, we need to understand the underlying dataset. You will never be an expert on the data you are working with, and will always need to explore the variables in great depth before you can move on to building a model or doing something else with the data. Effective data visualization is the most important tool in your arsenal for getting this done, and hence an critical skill for you to master.

<p>In this blog, I am going to talk about the&nbsp;<strong>reasons why your business should use Podcasting.</strong>Podcasting has garnered an immense popularity over the years. A&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;is a set of digital audio files that are available on the internet for downloading. A user can subscribe to the podcast to receive the digital files once they are uploaded.</p>



<p>Businesses nowadays are increasingly using podcasts to improve their prospects. It is a powerful marketing tool. Podcasts have become the new talk radio on mobile devices. In fact, the increased usage of mobile phones has led to the explosive growth of podcasting.</p>



<p>“If you’re a business in an industry that has a high customer value, then a podcast may be one of your most effective education and marketing tools,” says Spencer Shaw, founder of the podcast production firm<strong>PodKick Media.</strong></p>



<p>More than one-third (39%) of owners of SMBs listen to podcasts, and 65% listen at least weekly,&nbsp;according to a survey by small business research firm Bredin. Listenership increases with company size, found that 70-72% of owners of businesses with 100 to 500 employees are tuning in.</p>



<p>You can’t demonstrate your credibility without sharing your expertise, and by sharing your expertise you become helpful. You become valuable for your listeners,” explains Stephen Woessner on his podcast&nbsp;Onward Nation, a daily podcast for business owners.</p>
