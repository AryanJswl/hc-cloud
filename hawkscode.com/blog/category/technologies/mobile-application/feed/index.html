<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about the how to create wireframes for your application. Wireframes are the base of any application. </p>



<p>Regardless of how excellent your idea for a&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;is, if you don’t know where to start and how to go about it, it will fail. Our consistent response to such confusion is – wireframe!</p>



<p style="font-size:0"><strong><span style="color:#27aae2" class="has-inline-color">Wireframing</span></strong> is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on the way client want to see your application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Wireframe Show?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, it’s a two-dimensional skeleton of what your future mobile app will look like. It shows:</p>



<ul><li>Content prioritization</li><li>Space distribution</li><li>Intended actions</li><li>Available features and functions</li><li>Transitions between screens</li></ul>



<p><strong>Wireframes</strong> can drawn on paper, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your <strong>website or product</strong>. In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:</p>



<ul><li>Wireframe &gt; Interactive Prototype &gt; Visual &gt; Design</li><li>Sketch &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Hi-Def Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Integral Aspects of a Website</h2>



<p>In the beginning focus on integral aspects of a website. Firstly don’t even consider the design aesthetics for now. The colors, themes, fonts, and images can be taken care of later.</p>



<p>You must have a clear understanding of the features you need in your final product.&nbsp;Prepare a list and include all the things you actually need in your app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to aim at excellent user experience with your app. What’s the first thing users will see after launching your app? How will this screen guide them for further navigation? How can users take specific actions? Is it going to be easier for them to figure out?</p>



<p>UX can be abstract and complicated. Because, just like everything else on the Internet, the UX is also evolving at a tremendous pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now you are ready to start putting these ideas down. </h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to use pen and paper to start designing your UX, UI when there are tonnes of applications available in the market which that you can easy build one for you. </p>



<p>Now before ending this I want to share some tools name that can be very useful for building wireframes.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><strong>Balsmiq</strong>, <strong>draw.io</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>, <strong>Figma</strong> are the free tools available online. You can easily start working on these start putting your ideas and start building your application.</p>

<p><strong>Quantum internet breakthrough could help make hacking a thing</strong>. The advent of mass working from home has made many people more aware of the security risks of sending sensitive information via the internet. The best we can do at the moment is make it difficult to intercept and hack your messages – but we can’t make it impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we need is a new type of internet:</h2>



<p> the quantum internet. In this version of the global network, data is secure, connections are private and your worries about information being intercepted are a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Our current way of protecting online data is to encrypt it using mathematical problem that are easy to solve if you have a digital “key” to unlock the encryption but hard to solve without it. However, hard does not mean impossible and, with enough time and computer power, today’s methods of encryption can be broken.</p>



<p>Entanglement is so useful that it is set to become a resource itself, like data or electricity or water. And the primary purpose of the quantum internet is to distribute and exploit this resource in the form of entangled particles.</p>



<p>Quantum communication, on the other hand, creates keys using individual particles of light (photons) , which – according to the principles of quantum physics – are impossible to make an exact copy of. Any attempt to copy these keys will unavoidably cause errors that can be detected. This means a hacker, no matter how clever or powerful they are or what kind of supercomputer they possess, cannot replicate a quantum key or read the message it encrypts.</p>



<p>There is a catch, however. Entanglement is relatively straightforward to produce — quantum optics labs all over the world can produce it more or less on demand. But it is fragile, hard to store and tricky to transmit.</p>



<p>That’s why quantum networks are so difficult to build. Almost any outside interference destroys entanglement. Sneeze and you lose it.</p>



<p>So much of the practical work involved in creating quantum networks is in purifying, storing and boosting entanglement as it travels over long distances.</p>

<p><strong>What is State in React?</strong>&nbsp;<em>State</em>&nbsp;is a JavaScript object that stores component’s dynamic data and it enables a component to keep track of changes between renders. Because state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity so you don’t use it for static React projects.</p>



<p>Components defined as classes have some additional features. Local&nbsp;<em>state</em>&nbsp;is exactly that: a feature available only to classes. S<em>tate</em>&nbsp;can only be used within a class and usually the only place where you can assign&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;is the constructor.</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br><strong>constructor()&nbsp;</strong>{<br><strong>super()</strong>;<strong>this</strong>.state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br>state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<h2 class="has-very-dark-gray-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>State Updates May Be Asynchronous</strong></h2>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>React may batch multiple&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls into a single update for performance. Calls to&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;are asynchronous when they are inside event handlers and that when you don’t rely on&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;to reflect the new value immediately after calling&nbsp;<em>setState</em>.</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br>// Note: this will *not* work as intended.<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong>count: this.state.count + 1<strong>}</strong>);<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>&nbsp;this</strong>.incrementCount();<br>// When React re-renders the component, `this.state.count` will be 1, but you expected 3.</p>



<p>// This is because `incrementCount()` function above reads from `this.state.count`,<br>// but React doesn’t update `this.state.count` until the component is re-rendered.<br>// So `incrementCount()` ends up reading `this.state.count` as 0 every time, and sets it to 1.</p>



<p>To fix it, use a second form of&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;that accepts a function rather than an object to ensure the call always uses the most updated version of&nbsp;<em>state</em>. i hope now it’s clear to you&nbsp;<strong>What is State in React?</strong></p>



<p>Passing an update function allows you to access the&nbsp;<em>current state value</em>&nbsp;inside the updater. Since&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;calls are batched, this lets you chain updates and ensure they build on top of each other instead of conflicting:</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; {<br>// Important: read `state` instead of `this.state` when updating.<br>return {count:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.count + 1}<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();</p>



<p>// If you read `this.state.count` now, it would still be 0.<br>// But when React re-renders the component, it will be 3.<br>}</p>



<p>Also you can pass&nbsp;<em>props</em>&nbsp;as a second argument at the time the update is applied:</p>



<p>// Correct<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>props)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; ({<br>counter:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.counter +&nbsp;<strong>props</strong>.increment<br>}));</p>



<p><strong>State Updates are Merged</strong></p>



<p>When you call&nbsp;setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.</p>



<p>For instance, your state may contain several independent variables:</p>



<p>constructor(<strong>props</strong>) {<br>super(<strong>props</strong>);<br><strong>this</strong>.state = {<br>posts: [],<br>comments: []<br>};<br>}</p>



<p>Then you can update them independently with separate&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls:</p>



<p>componentDidMount() {<br>fetchPosts().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>posts: response.posts<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});</p>



<p>fetchComments().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>comments: response.comments<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>The merging is shallow, so&nbsp;this.setState({comments})&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;this.state.posts&nbsp;intact, but completely replaces&nbsp;this.state.comments.</p>



<p>You might be asking what is&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;and how it is used. It is a method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. So if you need to load data from a remote endpoint (API), this is a good place to instantiate the network request.</p>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>As you can see in the above example the properties for&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;are now independent and separately added&nbsp;this.setState&nbsp;, passed an object to each property and surrounded them by&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;where they will be added to the DOM tree after we get the response from the&nbsp;fetchPosts()&nbsp;and&nbsp;fetchComments().</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about Will robots and AI take our jobs in covid-19’s socially distanced era? Coronavirus has put a rocket below plans for extra automation, roboticisation and use of AI. Ought to we worry for our jobs – or will we simply get higher ones?</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a fundamental impact on the global labour market in the next few years. Therefore, the authors discuss legal, economic and business issues, such as changes in the future labour market and in company structures, impact on working time, remuneration and on the working environment, new forms of employment and the impact on labour relations.</p>



<p>At many places you can see clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst<strong> UV Bot, with its 1000 watts’ </strong>worth of UVC light capable of “tearing apart strands of virus DNA”, comes here every night, as well as to a few other<strong> malls and hospitals in Singapore</strong>. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the covid-19 pandemic: cleaning.</p>



<p>Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals, Moxi delivers medications, lab samples and supplies. P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets. James the telepresence bot helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking the coronavirus’s genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.</p>



<p>This trend towards automation and roboticisation isn’t new – but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. “What this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance”, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. “In these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.”</p>



<p>And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone – with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?</p>



<p>So is there any solution to this problem is Robot is going to capture the market which will lead to unemployment. But yes in today&#8217;s time it is difficult to get a robot for petty works because it&#8217;s costing is too high but yes in future we are going to totally rely on robots for petty work also.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In this blog you will get a idea about what is amazon web services and their products. <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>cloud service platform</strong>, offering computing power,storage ,database and other service to help business scale and grow. Cloud provides IT resources on Internet with pay-per-price. You need not to buy any physical storage or server instead you can take it on rent at a very cheap price. There is a huge list of products offer by&nbsp;<strong>AWS&nbsp;</strong>but the major one is&nbsp;<strong>EC2</strong>, Amazon’s virtual machine service&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>S3</strong>, Amazon’s storage system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud</strong>&nbsp;<strong>EC2</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud</strong>&nbsp;<strong>EC2</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>web service&nbsp;</strong>that provide securable, scalable computer capacity in cloud.&nbsp;<strong>EC2&nbsp;</strong>eliminates the need to invest in hardware, So you can develop and deploy applications faster. EC2 is used to run virtual machine in cloud. AWS calls these virtual machine instances.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service S3</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service S3</strong>&nbsp;provides web storage through web service interface. S3 enables customers to upload, store and download practically any file or object that is up to five terabytes (TB) in size. It is durable for objects store in service and support multiple security. To learn more about<strong>&nbsp;AWS cloud</strong>&nbsp;visit&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.easyshiksha.com/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshiksha</span></strong></a>.</p>



<p>Save costs without sacrificing performance by storing data across the&nbsp;S3 Storage Classes, which support different data access levels at corresponding rates. You can use&nbsp;S3 Storage Class Analysis&nbsp;to discover data that should move to a lower-cost storage class based on access patterns, and configure an&nbsp;S3 Lifecycle&nbsp;policy to execute the transfer.</p>
