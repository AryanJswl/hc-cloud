<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>

<p>This language helps in making web pages <strong>interactive</strong> and <strong>dynamic </strong>which makes it essential addition among web applications. Nowadays, almost every website and <strong>web applications</strong> use JavaScript and almost every web browser has a dedicated JavaScript engine embedded in them. Though, initially intended for the purpose for improving web applications its vast properties were explored and then, later on, people recognised if we could embed it into host software then it could be used for many purposes server-side programming in web servers, databases, in word processors etc.</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about the how to create wireframes for your application. Wireframes are the base of any application. </p>



<p>Regardless of how excellent your idea for a&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;is, if you don’t know where to start and how to go about it, it will fail. Our consistent response to such confusion is – wireframe!</p>



<p style="font-size:0"><strong><span style="color:#27aae2" class="has-inline-color">Wireframing</span></strong> is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on the way client want to see your application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Wireframe Show?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, it’s a two-dimensional skeleton of what your future mobile app will look like. It shows:</p>



<ul><li>Content prioritization</li><li>Space distribution</li><li>Intended actions</li><li>Available features and functions</li><li>Transitions between screens</li></ul>



<p><strong>Wireframes</strong> can drawn on paper, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your <strong>website or product</strong>. In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:</p>



<ul><li>Wireframe &gt; Interactive Prototype &gt; Visual &gt; Design</li><li>Sketch &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Hi-Def Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Integral Aspects of a Website</h2>



<p>In the beginning focus on integral aspects of a website. Firstly don’t even consider the design aesthetics for now. The colors, themes, fonts, and images can be taken care of later.</p>



<p>You must have a clear understanding of the features you need in your final product.&nbsp;Prepare a list and include all the things you actually need in your app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to aim at excellent user experience with your app. What’s the first thing users will see after launching your app? How will this screen guide them for further navigation? How can users take specific actions? Is it going to be easier for them to figure out?</p>



<p>UX can be abstract and complicated. Because, just like everything else on the Internet, the UX is also evolving at a tremendous pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now you are ready to start putting these ideas down. </h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to use pen and paper to start designing your UX, UI when there are tonnes of applications available in the market which that you can easy build one for you. </p>



<p>Now before ending this I want to share some tools name that can be very useful for building wireframes.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><strong>Balsmiq</strong>, <strong>draw.io</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>, <strong>Figma</strong> are the free tools available online. You can easily start working on these start putting your ideas and start building your application.</p>

<p><strong>Quantum internet breakthrough could help make hacking a thing</strong>. The advent of mass working from home has made many people more aware of the security risks of sending sensitive information via the internet. The best we can do at the moment is make it difficult to intercept and hack your messages – but we can’t make it impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we need is a new type of internet:</h2>



<p> the quantum internet. In this version of the global network, data is secure, connections are private and your worries about information being intercepted are a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Our current way of protecting online data is to encrypt it using mathematical problem that are easy to solve if you have a digital “key” to unlock the encryption but hard to solve without it. However, hard does not mean impossible and, with enough time and computer power, today’s methods of encryption can be broken.</p>



<p>Entanglement is so useful that it is set to become a resource itself, like data or electricity or water. And the primary purpose of the quantum internet is to distribute and exploit this resource in the form of entangled particles.</p>



<p>Quantum communication, on the other hand, creates keys using individual particles of light (photons) , which – according to the principles of quantum physics – are impossible to make an exact copy of. Any attempt to copy these keys will unavoidably cause errors that can be detected. This means a hacker, no matter how clever or powerful they are or what kind of supercomputer they possess, cannot replicate a quantum key or read the message it encrypts.</p>



<p>There is a catch, however. Entanglement is relatively straightforward to produce — quantum optics labs all over the world can produce it more or less on demand. But it is fragile, hard to store and tricky to transmit.</p>



<p>That’s why quantum networks are so difficult to build. Almost any outside interference destroys entanglement. Sneeze and you lose it.</p>



<p>So much of the practical work involved in creating quantum networks is in purifying, storing and boosting entanglement as it travels over long distances.</p>

<p><strong>What is State in React?</strong>&nbsp;<em>State</em>&nbsp;is a JavaScript object that stores component’s dynamic data and it enables a component to keep track of changes between renders. Because state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity so you don’t use it for static React projects.</p>



<p>Components defined as classes have some additional features. Local&nbsp;<em>state</em>&nbsp;is exactly that: a feature available only to classes. S<em>tate</em>&nbsp;can only be used within a class and usually the only place where you can assign&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;is the constructor.</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br><strong>constructor()&nbsp;</strong>{<br><strong>super()</strong>;<strong>this</strong>.state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br>state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<h2 class="has-very-dark-gray-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>State Updates May Be Asynchronous</strong></h2>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>React may batch multiple&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls into a single update for performance. Calls to&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;are asynchronous when they are inside event handlers and that when you don’t rely on&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;to reflect the new value immediately after calling&nbsp;<em>setState</em>.</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br>// Note: this will *not* work as intended.<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong>count: this.state.count + 1<strong>}</strong>);<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>&nbsp;this</strong>.incrementCount();<br>// When React re-renders the component, `this.state.count` will be 1, but you expected 3.</p>



<p>// This is because `incrementCount()` function above reads from `this.state.count`,<br>// but React doesn’t update `this.state.count` until the component is re-rendered.<br>// So `incrementCount()` ends up reading `this.state.count` as 0 every time, and sets it to 1.</p>



<p>To fix it, use a second form of&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;that accepts a function rather than an object to ensure the call always uses the most updated version of&nbsp;<em>state</em>. i hope now it’s clear to you&nbsp;<strong>What is State in React?</strong></p>



<p>Passing an update function allows you to access the&nbsp;<em>current state value</em>&nbsp;inside the updater. Since&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;calls are batched, this lets you chain updates and ensure they build on top of each other instead of conflicting:</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; {<br>// Important: read `state` instead of `this.state` when updating.<br>return {count:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.count + 1}<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();</p>



<p>// If you read `this.state.count` now, it would still be 0.<br>// But when React re-renders the component, it will be 3.<br>}</p>



<p>Also you can pass&nbsp;<em>props</em>&nbsp;as a second argument at the time the update is applied:</p>



<p>// Correct<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>props)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; ({<br>counter:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.counter +&nbsp;<strong>props</strong>.increment<br>}));</p>



<p><strong>State Updates are Merged</strong></p>



<p>When you call&nbsp;setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.</p>



<p>For instance, your state may contain several independent variables:</p>



<p>constructor(<strong>props</strong>) {<br>super(<strong>props</strong>);<br><strong>this</strong>.state = {<br>posts: [],<br>comments: []<br>};<br>}</p>



<p>Then you can update them independently with separate&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls:</p>



<p>componentDidMount() {<br>fetchPosts().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>posts: response.posts<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});</p>



<p>fetchComments().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>comments: response.comments<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>The merging is shallow, so&nbsp;this.setState({comments})&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;this.state.posts&nbsp;intact, but completely replaces&nbsp;this.state.comments.</p>



<p>You might be asking what is&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;and how it is used. It is a method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. So if you need to load data from a remote endpoint (API), this is a good place to instantiate the network request.</p>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>As you can see in the above example the properties for&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;are now independent and separately added&nbsp;this.setState&nbsp;, passed an object to each property and surrounded them by&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;where they will be added to the DOM tree after we get the response from the&nbsp;fetchPosts()&nbsp;and&nbsp;fetchComments().</p>

<p>Today we will learn about <strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components</strong>. In the previous article I had talk about<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"> </span><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/how-to-become-a-salesforce-developer/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">How to become a Salesforce Developer</span></a></strong>.The <strong>Lightning Component</strong> framework is a UI framework for developing web apps for mobile and desktop devices. It’s a modern framework for building single-page applications with dynamic, responsive user interfaces for <strong>Lightning</strong> Platform apps. It uses JavaScript on the client side and Apex on the server side. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introducing Lightning Web Components</strong></h2>



<p>Now you can build Lightning components using two programming models:&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Web Components</strong>, and the original model,&nbsp;<strong>Aura Components</strong>. Lightning web components are custom HTML elements built using&nbsp;<strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;and modern&nbsp;<strong>JavaScript</strong>. Lightning web components and Aura components can coexist and interoperate on a page. To admins and end users, they both appear as Lightning components.&nbsp;<strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components.</strong></p>



<p>Lightning Web Components uses core Web Components standards and provides only what’s necessary to perform well in browsers supported by Salesforce. Because it’s built on code that runs natively in browsers, Lightning Web Components is lightweight and delivers exceptional performance. Most of the code you write is standard JavaScript and HTML.</p>



<p>Salesforce is committed to developing open web standards and is a member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp;<strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components.</strong></p>



<p>Base Lightning components are available as&nbsp;<strong>Aura components</strong>&nbsp;and as&nbsp;<strong>Lightning web components</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>Component Reference&nbsp;</strong>includes documentation, specifications, and examples for both. See Base Components: Aura Vs Lightning Web Components for differences between them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create Lightning Web Components</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="705" height="430" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5584" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce.png 705w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-300x183.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-696x425.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-689x420.png 689w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure>



<p>A Lightning web component is a reusable custom HTML element with its own API.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Define a Component</strong></h2>



<p>A Lightning web component that renders UI must include an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a metadata configuration file. The files must use the same name so the framework can autowire them. A service component (library) must include a JavaScript file and a metadata configuration file.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTML Templates</strong></h2>



<p>The power of Lightning Web Components is the templating system, which uses the virtual DOM to render components smartly and efficiently. It’s a best practice to let LWC manipulate the DOM instead of writing JavaScript to do it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CSS</strong></h2>



<p>To style components, use Lightning Design System or CSS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reactivity</strong></h2>



<p>Reactivity is a system at the core of the Lightning Web Components framework. The framework observes changes to the values of fields and properties. When it observes a change, it reacts. It reevaluates all the expressions used in the template and rerenders the component, which displays the new values.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Composition</strong></h2>



<p>You can add components within the body of another component. Composition enables you to build complex components from simpler building-block components.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fields, Properties, and Attributes</strong></h2>



<p>Declare fields in your component’s JavaScript class. Reference them in your component’s template to dynamically update content.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>Every component must have a JavaScript file. JavaScript files in Lightning web components are ES6 modules.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Access Static Resources, Labels, Internationalization Properties, User IDs, and Form Factors</strong></h2>



<p>Lightning components can access global Salesforce values, such as labels, resources, and users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Component Accessibility</strong></h2>



<p>Accessible software and assistive technologies enable users with disabilities to use the products you build. Develop your components so that all users can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Component Lifecycle</strong></h2>



<p>Lightning web components have a lifecycle managed by the framework. The framework creates components, inserts them into the DOM, renders them, and removes them from the DOM. It also monitors components for property changes. Generally, components don’t need to call these lifecycle hooks, but it is possible.</p>
