<p>In this article, we are going to learn about&nbsp;<strong>the top five programming languages of the world</strong>, you should start learning now.</p>



<p>Have you ever heard of python? C? C++?Java? All will say “what are you talking about? A non-programmer ever know this!” That’s true. IncludeHelp also knows that his readers have already explored a few miles on the road of C, C++, Java, and Python. Maybe still miles to go, but you all know about the languages. Below is the <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Python</strong></h2>



<p>This century loves to work with data, loves to train their machine and believes in artificial intelligence. Python is such a genuine &amp; general purpose language that helps you to explore all that you want to do. Python has been announced as the “most popular language of 2018” by&nbsp;TIOBE index. We believe the same too. Python is probably the best weapon of a geek who is working on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development of course.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Python first:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not difficult to learn</li><li>Multiple programming paradigms</li><li>Robust standard library</li><li>A nice platform for developers</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>We have listed JavaScript as 2nd one due to his huge usage and demand in the ongoing tech-world. JavaScript is the basic building block for any frontend application. Now a days NodeJs is widely used for website development frameworks, which is actually JavaScript based.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JavaScript:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Must one for Full-stack developer</li><li>Needed to fame any frontend application</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Swift</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png" alt="Top Five Programming Languages of the World" class="wp-image-5728" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-300x171.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-768x439.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-696x398.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-735x420.png 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Swift is a scripting language which has become so popular in last few years only. It was launched in 2014 and has introduced now a high-paid career path. This is mainly being used in distributed computing as it allows writing scripts that distribute program execution across distributed computing resources, including clusters, clouds, grids, and supercomputers.Swift is being constantly used in economic and biometric modelling.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Swift:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Has a great future opportunity regarding career</li><li>A really nice scripting language4.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Java</h2>



<p>You all are familiar a bit with Java. Probably, this was the language you learnt in your past school times or maybe junior college days. Java is powerful for its Object Oriented paradigm. Java is most famous for android development, IOT, edge device development. Strong OOP concept felicitates java as top application developing language.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JAVA:</strong></p>



<p>Object oriented nature Java applets</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. C++</strong></h2>



<p>C++ is known to be a core language. It’s a highly efficient &amp; reliable language. It has been on demand due to high performance &amp; wide usage. Do you know Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X Google application (most of them), Mozilla Firefox, Adobe systems (major applications) are written in C++? <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We all have heard of web services once if you are in IT or <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/"><strong>website development</strong></a></span>. If you look up to the Internet then you will find that it has several definitions and several uses. In simple words, we can say that it is an open standard based web applications that interact with other applications. Also, it can turn your current application into a web application. So here we will be discussing WHAT, WHY and HOW of web service.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>What is a Web Service?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web services are like an application that communicates with other application or web application with a standard XML messaging system. XML encodes communication of a web service with other. As all the communication is happening XML that makes it platform independent. Now JAVA can communicate with Perl or Unix with Windows. Web services are not dependent on what language another application is or on which OS it is running. Use of XML encoded communication made this happen here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words from the Internet, we can say it is completely modular, distributed and dynamic application. When it is invoked, called or executed it creates products, supply chain and process. These web services are built on the top open standards as HTTP, IP, HTML, XML. A Web service uses the Internet as a medium of the conversation with another application. Web services create a communication line that serves as internal comm line of one system. A web service requires 3 basic elements for itself:</p>
<p><strong>A. SOAP (Simple Access Object Protocol)</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. WSDL (Web Service Description Language)</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4804"></span></p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>How does a Web Service Work?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we have discussed that Web services use open standards like HTML, XML, SOAP to build a communication bridge between applications. For this it takes help of:</p>
<p><strong>XML</strong>: It tags or encodes the data that need to be transferred between applications.</p>
<p><strong>SOAP</strong>: It is a way to send the message from the client or provokers side.</p>
<p><strong>WSDL</strong>: It let web service know that if the server is available or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So you can build a service based on the JAVA on editors. This service is easily accessible by the visual basic that run on windows. Also, you can make web services on C# on the Windows and call it on Linux based system. There will be no change in its objective or working module.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Why One Need Web Services?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a web service is prepared, it becomes a unit of managed code. This code can be revoked by sending a request via the network. Once your service is exposed on the Internet other applications can start communicating with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web services are used to makes applications independent of the language and applications. As we talked about it, it is a communication medium. Now a Java-based application talks to a Visual Basic-based application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web services use standardized standard web industry protocol. All the layer of the service uses well-defined protocols pf the services. This increases quality, choices and reduces the cost of the service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of using B2B/ EDI proprietary solutions for communication, it uses SOAP over HTTP. More cost effective and works well on the low-cost internet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, actually one cannot decide which language is best for web development. What is best for one developer can be a crap for another web developer. It is just matter of skills set developer to have. If one developer has good skills with one language it is best for him. Development is basically based on the control over the language. To make development more beautiful one can use 2 or more different programming languages.</p>
<p>So let’s start our topic here with:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/php/" target="_blank">PHP</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP made its debut in mid-1990. It was a revolutionary application that made it possible for a website to have a dynamic data. Before this website used to be a bulk of static data but this changed it all. It made those boring website more interactive. PHP has one problem and that is a length of the code for small tasks. It requires a lot of code to make small tasks work on a website. After 2 decades there are many languages those can replace PHP. But still the PHP is ruling its place and most programmer still prefers this language.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">Java</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was never made for <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development</a></strong></span> or web applications but still, Java is said to be one of best programing language. Java had a different sole purpose, but still, get used in website development. Java is having a very long timeline so if you are into a project that will be altered by your people or other then use Java. Why? Because a basic developer knows Java well. Java’s sole purpose was never browser related development. So if you write code in Java your team will not need new to learns to make a change or maintaining code.</p>
<h3><strong>Go a.k.a. Golang:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This language is like an extension to any development language. It is flexible and easier than Java for web applications. Go is a general purpose language but not that popular. But it has an advantage when used for applications that work on parallel processing. This advantage increases its chances of being liked in future. So it will be a good option for you to do development of web application or other application.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/python/" target="_blank">Python</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Python was also not made for web development. But then Django (a python framework) made it all easy for developers. Due to this framework, a website developer can implement functionalities from python to a website. You can also use plain old Python to do application or web development.</p>
