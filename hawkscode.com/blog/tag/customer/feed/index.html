<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are thousands of competing </span></span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/business/online-lending-sites-offer-alternative-to-traditional-borrowing.html"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>websites that offer loans</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> and other lucrative financial services to people who need them. To have a chance of competing for a piece of the pie, finance websites must incorporate the design that encourages visitors to turn into customers as effectively as possible. Each potential visitor could be worth thousands of dollars depending on the financial product being offered.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The finance market is huge, but so is the competition. This is why it is important to be able to </span></span><a href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/turn-visitors-into-customers/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>convert your visitors into customers</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most finance businesses worry about </span></span><a href="https://hawkscode.com.au/services/digital-marketing/Search-Engine-Optimization_/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>search engine optimisation</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> (SEO) first, but very few really care for conversion, without which SEO would be useless.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">According to ‘</span></span><a href="https://marketingexperiments.com/conversion-marketing/conversion-rate-averages"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>Marketing Experiments</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">’ the average conversion rate for websites within the finance industry is close to 10%. When comparing to retail or e-commerce which averages 3%, is very good, especially when considering the value of each paying finance customer.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it is possible to increase this rate as some top online financial companies enjoy conversion rate of 15% and more. If you want to be among such companies as well then you have landed on the right page.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Given below are five value tips on how to convert your visitors into buyers.</span></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>1. Work on the Layout and Presentation</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Make sure to keep your website layout simple and easy navigate so visitors ‘know what you do’ and can quickly find what they need. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Financial sites should be clutter free and not use a lot of colors. Simple colors, such as white and light shades of blue, </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">can do the trick. Below is a great example of a small business loans website operated by </span></span><a href="https://www.unsecuredbusinessloans.com.au/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">www.unsecuredbusinessloans.com.au</span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">. They use white space effectively and provide clear messaging to get their point across of who they are, what they do and how to get started. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5232" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2.jpg" alt="" width="1611" height="805" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2.jpg 1611w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2-768x384.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2-1024x512.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2-696x348.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2-1068x534.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-2-841x420.jpg 841w" sizes="(max-width: 1611px) 100vw, 1611px" /></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>2. Make Sure to Provide All Information</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Provide visitors with all the information they might need so that they have no reason to go to another website.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, the right information depends on a number of factors, most importantly as a financial services business in Australia you must display your </span></span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/afs-licensees/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>Australian Financial Services Licence</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> (AFSL).</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If your business offers home loans, you should provide all details on the website such as loan amount, repayment time, interest rates and any fees for acquiring the loan.</span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>3. Give Importance to the Call For Action</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You have to tell visitors what to do so that they can do it. For example, if you want them to hire your consultancy services, push them to do so by having a call to action button on your page, which should be strategically placed.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The button should ideally be on the top of the page or at the bottom so that it is easily visible to your visitors. Moreover, it should be readable and attractive. You can also use other effective CTA methods. See what works the best for you.</span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>4. Add Authenticity and Let Customers Reach You</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Add some authenticity to your site by providing details such as your company history, physical address and contact number. This would help users have more faith in your company, which is very important in this job. Why would anyone want to deal with a company that they do not trust?</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You should be available to answer all questions over calls, emails and also live chat, which is said to be the most effective method when it comes to getting in touch with your customers.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Live chat is affordable and offers great ROI as well. Moreover, you can also add an FAQ section to your site and cover all questions related to your business so that users have no problem in finding what they need.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5233" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-3.png" alt="" width="525" height="350" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-3.png 525w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-3-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>5. Make Your Site Safe and Secure</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Security is of huge importance especially when it comes to financial matters. Hacking is a big challenge that almost all businesses have to face. Visitors would not be interested in working with you if your website appears shady or unsafe.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are a number of things you can do to make things right. Firstly, follow security protocols and make sure to keep your site updated at all times.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition to this, make use of a reliable and trusted payment gateway like </span></span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>PayPal</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> and </span></span><a href="https://www.2checkout.com/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>2Checkout</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">. Such options are well known in the industry and can convince people to put in their personal details such as credit card information without any worries.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This is it. Just follow these simple tips and you will have no problem in improving your website’s rate of conversion.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a strategy for managing all your company&#8217;s relationships and interactions with your customers and potential customers. It helps you improve your profitability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More commonly, when people talk about CRM they are usually referring to a CRM system. A tool which helps with contact management, sales management, workflow processes, productivity and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customer Relationship Management enables you to focus on your organisation’s relationships with individual people – whether those are customers, service users, colleagues or suppliers. It is not just for sales. Some of the biggest gains in productivity can come from moving beyond CRM as a sales and marketing tool. Then embed it in your business – from HR to customer services and supply-chain management.</p>
<h3>Why CRM Matter?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your business is going to last, you know that you need a strategy for the future. You’ll already have targets relating to sales, business objectives and profitability. But getting up-to-date, reliable information on your progress towards your goals can be tricky. How do you translate the many streams of data coming in from sales teams, customer service staff, marketers and social media monitoring into useful business information?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using a CRM system can give you a clear overview of your customers. You can see everything in one place. A simple, customisable dashboard that can tell you a customer&#8217;s previous history with you. Also the status of their orders, any outstanding customer service issues, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can even choose to include information from their public social media activity- their likes and dislikes, what they are saying and sharing with you. Marketers can use CRM to better understand the pipeline of sales or prospective work coming in, making forecasting simpler and more accurate. You&#8217;ll have clear visibility of every opportunity or lead, showing you the clear path from enquiries to sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And though it’s traditionally been used as a sales and marketing tool, customer service teams are seeing great benefits from CRM systems. Today&#8217;s customer raises their voices on the social channel like Twitter. Then they more this conversation to private email or calls. A CRM platform enables you to manage the enquiry across channels without losing track.</p>
