<p>In this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss</strong>. In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I’ve heard it all:</p>



<ul><li>“You can’t have privacy if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have security if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t get upgrades if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have a good user experience if you use Android!”</li><li>“YOU CAN’T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!”</li></ul>



<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;</em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I’m here to tell you they’re all equally misguided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now, don’t get me wrong:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a&nbsp;<em>nugget</em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we’re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don’t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don’t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).</p>



<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself — as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform — overlooks one key point. It’s a foundational reality of Android that’s been at the system’s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches</strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app’s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</strong></p>



<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner — that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;an “Android way” — not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.</p>



<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it’s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Same level of choice and control</strong></h2>



<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world’s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.</p>



<p>It’s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story — the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choice and control within Android</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll start with privacy — an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn’t actually that it’s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It’s simply that Google’s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don’t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it — at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.</p>



<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults — and most people aren’t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What’s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide</strong>; it’s just up to you to embrace it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>What about security? Well, it’s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources —&nbsp;<em>the horror!</em>&nbsp;— but, y’know, it’s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they’ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It’s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>That brings us to the realm of updates — both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It’s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion</strong></h2>



<p>The Pixel, as I’ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It’s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company’s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be — a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn’t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it’s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>to make. There’s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone’s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities — and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Android and iOS</strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates ’em. Neither platform’s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn about&nbsp;<strong>the top five programming languages of the world</strong>, you should start learning now.</p>



<p>Have you ever heard of python? C? C++?Java? All will say “what are you talking about? A non-programmer ever know this!” That’s true. IncludeHelp also knows that his readers have already explored a few miles on the road of C, C++, Java, and Python. Maybe still miles to go, but you all know about the languages. Below is the <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Python</strong></h2>



<p>This century loves to work with data, loves to train their machine and believes in artificial intelligence. Python is such a genuine &amp; general purpose language that helps you to explore all that you want to do. Python has been announced as the “most popular language of 2018” by&nbsp;TIOBE index. We believe the same too. Python is probably the best weapon of a geek who is working on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development of course.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Python first:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not difficult to learn</li><li>Multiple programming paradigms</li><li>Robust standard library</li><li>A nice platform for developers</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>We have listed JavaScript as 2nd one due to his huge usage and demand in the ongoing tech-world. JavaScript is the basic building block for any frontend application. Now a days NodeJs is widely used for website development frameworks, which is actually JavaScript based.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JavaScript:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Must one for Full-stack developer</li><li>Needed to fame any frontend application</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Swift</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png" alt="Top Five Programming Languages of the World" class="wp-image-5728" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-300x171.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-768x439.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-696x398.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-735x420.png 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Swift is a scripting language which has become so popular in last few years only. It was launched in 2014 and has introduced now a high-paid career path. This is mainly being used in distributed computing as it allows writing scripts that distribute program execution across distributed computing resources, including clusters, clouds, grids, and supercomputers.Swift is being constantly used in economic and biometric modelling.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Swift:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Has a great future opportunity regarding career</li><li>A really nice scripting language4.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Java</h2>



<p>You all are familiar a bit with Java. Probably, this was the language you learnt in your past school times or maybe junior college days. Java is powerful for its Object Oriented paradigm. Java is most famous for android development, IOT, edge device development. Strong OOP concept felicitates java as top application developing language.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JAVA:</strong></p>



<p>Object oriented nature Java applets</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. C++</strong></h2>



<p>C++ is known to be a core language. It’s a highly efficient &amp; reliable language. It has been on demand due to high performance &amp; wide usage. Do you know Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X Google application (most of them), Mozilla Firefox, Adobe systems (major applications) are written in C++? <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>

It feels great when the education institute takes the future of their students seriously and do anything that is within their reach to benefit these students. A few days back JEC College, Kukas, Jaipur approached us to conduct a workshop on IT technologies. This workshop will be like a light on the choice they will make in future, to awake these students in what tech they are good. In my opinion, the workshop is a really important part of a student life.</p>
<h2><strong>Little Light on 2 Day Workshop</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is like an opportunity that was brought to our door to be a part in shaping the future of these students. Our team decided to conducts this workshop for 2 days on August 10, 2018 and August 11, 2018.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We were surprised with the energy that those students were having and that warm welcome we received was an amazing experience. This much students taking participation was a great thing. Seeing those bright eyes looking forward to us for the skills and experience we have gained in all these years. It is really a hard exercise to put all your into a 20-page slide but we have to do it very efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our three mentors took three different classed on different technology, one was PHP, one iOS and one android. Only getting knowledge from the book is not enough, this is still a big problem in The Indian Education system. Students are thought with the books but for their better future, they need industrial touch in their study. To give that internship and workshop are best practices.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">They had knowledge of these techniques and how they work but all this was limited to the book. We know this industrial knowledge do not come into exam but it gives them a third perspective. This helps them in solving complex problems in the future. And after this workshop, you can clearly see the confidence they now have to be in an IT Industry soon. Again it was an amazing experience for both the students and us.</p>
