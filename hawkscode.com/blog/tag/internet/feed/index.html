<p><strong>Quantum internet breakthrough could help make hacking a thing</strong>. The advent of mass working from home has made many people more aware of the security risks of sending sensitive information via the internet. The best we can do at the moment is make it difficult to intercept and hack your messages – but we can’t make it impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we need is a new type of internet:</h2>



<p> the quantum internet. In this version of the global network, data is secure, connections are private and your worries about information being intercepted are a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Our current way of protecting online data is to encrypt it using mathematical problem that are easy to solve if you have a digital “key” to unlock the encryption but hard to solve without it. However, hard does not mean impossible and, with enough time and computer power, today’s methods of encryption can be broken.</p>



<p>Entanglement is so useful that it is set to become a resource itself, like data or electricity or water. And the primary purpose of the quantum internet is to distribute and exploit this resource in the form of entangled particles.</p>



<p>Quantum communication, on the other hand, creates keys using individual particles of light (photons) , which – according to the principles of quantum physics – are impossible to make an exact copy of. Any attempt to copy these keys will unavoidably cause errors that can be detected. This means a hacker, no matter how clever or powerful they are or what kind of supercomputer they possess, cannot replicate a quantum key or read the message it encrypts.</p>



<p>There is a catch, however. Entanglement is relatively straightforward to produce — quantum optics labs all over the world can produce it more or less on demand. But it is fragile, hard to store and tricky to transmit.</p>



<p>That’s why quantum networks are so difficult to build. Almost any outside interference destroys entanglement. Sneeze and you lose it.</p>



<p>So much of the practical work involved in creating quantum networks is in purifying, storing and boosting entanglement as it travels over long distances.</p>

<p><strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.&nbsp;</strong>Network troubleshooting tools are a necessity for every network administrator. When getting started in the networking field, it is important to amass a number of tools that can be used to troubleshoot a variety of different network conditions.</p>



<p>While it is true that the the use of specific tools can be subjective and at the discretion of the engineer, the selection of tools in this article has been made based on their generality and common use. </p>



<p>Following are the <strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ping</strong></h2>



<p>The most commonly used network tool is the ping utility. This utility is used to provide a basic connectivity test between the requesting host and a destination host. This is done by using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) which has the ability to send an echo packet to a destination host and a mechanism to listen for a response from this host. Simply stated, if the requesting host receives a response from the destination host, this host is reachable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracert/traceroute</strong></h2>



<p>Typically, once the ping utility has been used to determine basic connectivity, the tracert/traceroute utility can used to determine more specific information about the path to the destination host including the route the packet takes and the response time of these intermediate hosts. The tracert utility and traceroute utilities perform the same function but operate on different operating systems, Tracert for Windows machines and traceroute for Linux/*nix based machines.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ipconfig/ifconfig</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most important things that must be completed when troubleshooting a networking issue is to find out the specific IP configuration of the variously affected hosts. Sometimes this information is already known when addressing is configured statically, but when a dynamic addressing method is used, the IP address of each host can potentially change often.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nslookup</strong></h2>



<p>networking issues revolve around issues with Dynamic Name System (DNS) address resolution issues. DNS is used by everyone using the Internet to resolve commonly known domain names (i.e. google.com) to commonly unknown IP addresses (i.e. 74.125.115.147). When this system does not work, most of the functionality that people are used to goes away, as there is no way to resolve this information. The nslookup utility can be used to lookup the specific IP address(es) associated with a domain name. If this utility is unable to resolve this information, there is a DNS issue. Along with simple lookup, the nslookup utility is able to query specific DNS servers to determine an issue with the default DNS servers configured on a host.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DNS Lookup</strong></h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>DNS Lookup</strong>&nbsp;tool retrieves domain name records for the domain name that you provide. You can use this to help diagnose problems and see if the problem originates from the domain name server — if you cannot return a domain’s records, you’ll know where to begin troubleshooting!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;allows you to test the validity and reachability of an email address. It makes sure that the email is syntactically valid and that it is available via an SMTP server. If you’re trying to cull false email addresses from your email list or something similar, this tool will be helpful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTTP Headers</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5712" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The HTTP Headers tool allows you to see what headers are returned by a web server for a specific domain name or IP Address. If you notice odd behavior with your HTTP connections, you can use this tool to troubleshoot the top-level domain. Alternatively, you can use it to check for redirection — minimizing these optimizes any links you might be using.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>URL Encode Decode</strong></h2>



<p>If you need to include special characters in your URL, you’ll need to encode them so that the URL remains valid. You can do this with&nbsp;<strong>URL Encode</strong>. Conversely, if a URL contains special characters and has been encoded, yet you want to see it in a more human-readable form, use&nbsp;<strong>URL Decode</strong>&nbsp;to standardize the URL.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WHO IS  Search</strong></h2>



<p>If you are curious as to who the responsible party (or parties) is behind a domain name, the <strong>WHOIS query</strong> will allow you to query multiple domain registrars’ databases. If the owner has chosen to hide their information, you can nevertheless return forwarding information.</p>

IOT is used to collect, send and act on data using from communication hardware, embedded sensor and processors. Sometimes it is also known as internet of everything. It works on M2M communication system. M2M is a machine to machine communication which acts on the information get from one another. These whole process it will complete in a cycle i.e. lifecycle.<br />
Now we will take a discussion about lifecycle of IOT. It is completed in four steps. First it will collect the information and communicate it with others. After communication, it will start to analyze them and act according to that.</p>
<p>IOT will gather the information from everywhere like home, office and manufacturing plant. It will communicate by sending data and events from source to destination through the network. For communication, it can use a cloud platform, data centre or a home network. IOT will analysis information from data by visualizing the data, building reports and filtering the data. It will take action on behalf of received information and data. It can communicate with other machine or can send a notification or talk to another system.</p>
<p>Now we will take a short discussion on working of IOT. It works on four technology. These are RFID, Sensor, Smart tech and nanotech. In RFID technology it track and identify the data of things. Sensor technology collects and process the data which is used to detect change in the physical status of things. After this, smart tech is used to enhance the network power through processing and developing network part. Nanotech, as its name explained, it will make smaller and smaller thing. Also, it makes able these things to connect and interact.</p>
<p>With the help of these four numerous technologies, it can perform some actions on things. These include the tagging, feeling, shrinking and thinking things. Tagging things means tracebility and addressability of real time item using RFID technology. Feeling things explains that it collects the data from the environment using primary data like sensors. Shrinking things uses the nanotechnology. It make the ability to interact and connects the smaller things in smart devices. It helps to make realizing and controlling on things.</p>
<p>Till now we understand the lifecycle and working of IOT. Apart from this there are some applications of IOT which make it more useful. Few of them are manufacturing, medical and healthcare systems, media, energy and infrastructure management.</p>
