<p>In this blog, I will discuss about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>. Imagine your computer could think like you do or even understand you? That future may not be now, but it’s one step closer, thanks to scientists and engineers and their recent discovery of a materials-based mimic for the neural signals responsible for transmitting information within the human brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus</h2>



<p>We are very closer to this reality where material that will change with temperature or an electrical stimulus. The team was able to clarify the mechanism driving this behavior by taking a new look at&nbsp;<strong>β’-CuxV2O5</strong>. A chameleon-like material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus. In the process, they zeroed in on how copper ions move around inside the material and how this subtle dance in turn sloshes electrons around to transform it.</p>



<p>Their research revealed that the movement of copper ions is the linchpin of an electrical conductivity change which can be leveraged to create electrical spikes in the same way that neurons function in the cerebral nervous system. <strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Material</h2>



<p>“Nature has given us materials with the appropriate types of behavior to mimic the information processing that occurs in a brain, but the ones characterized to date have had various limitations,”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of this work is to show that&nbsp;<strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong>&nbsp;and create electrically active materials with significantly improved neuromorphic properties. As we understand more, our materials will improve significantly, thus providing a new path to the continual technological advancement of our computing abilities.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer build a mimic</h2>



<p>A computer built to mimic the brain’s neural networks produces similar results to that of the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movement of Copper ions</h2>



<p>A very small movement of copper ions within the structure brings about a massive change in conductance in the whole material. Because of this movement of copper ions, the material transforms from insulating to conducting in response to external changes in temperature, applied voltage or applied current. There is a huge gap between the energy consumption of the brain and today’s supercomputers. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing allows us to investigate how close we can get to the energy efficiency of the brain using electronics.”</p>

It has been a long time since the fiber transformed sports accessories in the racing car, helicopter and commercial aircraft. The aerospace industry began to move towards the entire composite plane along with carbon and glass fibers after the 1950s.</p>
<p>As a result, Boeing and Airbus have started incorporating the composite material into the part of their material to the aircraft. In order to increase safety and strength and reduce weight and fuel consumption, the aerospace industry has started using carbon composite material instead of aluminum materials.</p>
<h2><strong>Future Composites Material Graphene</strong></h2>
<p>Graphene has been introduced by Andre Geim and came into circulation in 2004 when Nobel defeated konstantin Novoselov. The Graphene of 0.345 nm atom thickness is 100 times stronger than the strongest steel. It is almost transparent and can conduct heat and electricity.</p>
<p>Graphene has the feature of high conductivity as compared to carbon which helps to protect a plane from lightning strikes. Current airplanes are also safe from the lightning strike because of including copper mesh in its wing. But replacement of copper mesh by Graphene make the plane lighter and more fuel efficient. The high conductivity of Graphene acts as a de-ice plane that reduces the equipment cost with today’s chemical de-icing technology.</p>
<p>Graphene seems to be just as revolutionary as the Carbon Fiber technology. It would be interesting to see if Carbon Fiber materials coated with graphene are used in the Aviation industry which will substantially increase the safety and also reduce the weight of the aircraft without compromising with the strength of the composite.</p>
<p>We can conclude that application of Graphene for <strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/">aerospace and defense industry</a></span></strong> as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphene has Anti-fog Crystals that helps in de-icing.</li>
<li>It can replace steel because of having lightweight and stronger.</li>
<li>Protect from the lightning strike with anti-electric shock coating.</li>
<li>Increase efficiency with lower consumption of fuel.</li>
</ul>
