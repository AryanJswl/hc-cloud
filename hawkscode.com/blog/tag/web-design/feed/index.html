But as of Google 2019 rule for the search result has been made some points clear we can think that there are many points those will affect your website’s rank in a different manner.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Google Improving Its Algo For Ranking:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google has been improving its search engine, the number of details on your website that Google’s algorithm looks at has grown substantially. These details include the text and some of the dangling threads of information used to program your site.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Great amounts of research have been conducted to determine what these factors are and to what extent Google places value on each element. The results are ultimately educated guesses at best.  Google tells the world very little about how it ranks websites, at least not directly.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Does Google Ranking Work in 2019?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google uses a variety of factors in its algorithm to determine what results will be the most helpful for the user. It also uses latent semantic indexing, which uses search intent as an indicator of what results are the most relevant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google built its current algorithm around RankBrain, a machine learning (AI) algorithm Google uses to help sort and improve the search results. Backlinko condensed it pretty well:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">In short, RankBrain tweaks the algorithm on its own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Depending on the keyword, RankBrain will increase or decrease the importance of backlinks, content freshness, content length, domain authority, etc. Then, it looks at how Google searchers interact with new search results. If users like the new algorithm better, it stays. If not, RankBrain rolls back the old algorithm.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_5404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5404" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-5404 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png" alt="How Web Desing can Affect Your Search Engine Ranking" width="1024" height="387" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-300x113.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-768x290.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-696x263.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5404" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Backlinko</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The reason for this is because one search term can have hundreds of meanings. For example, if I conduct a search for the word “bathroom,” Google has no idea of what I’m really looking for. Possible results could range wildly, including:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Finding the nearest public restroom</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Defining what a bathroom is</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Emergency Plumbing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Bathroom remodeling companies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">News stories</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Home decor websites</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Cleaning advice</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bad design will hurt your SEO</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Someone goes online and searches for an answer, a service, or a product, and it leads them to your website. Sweet!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>…But</strong> <strong>suppose</strong> they choose not to engage with your content because of poor design. It’s too hard to read, too ugly, too complicated. They’ll return to the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) to find a better answer to their query.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop-ups:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Pop-ups can be useful, but serve as a pain point for your online audience, especially if they haven’t accessed any of your content yet. Use them sparingly, and not as soon as someone arrives at your site. Generally, you need to build trust with your audience before making an ask for their contact information or a commitment like subscription sign up.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illegible text:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you’ve chosen a font that is too small, too hard to read, or is presented as part of an offensive color scheme, people will not stick around to decipher your messaging. Using a readability tool will help you ensure that your text is always a delight for your visitors to read.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loud sounds:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;">You should never make audio tracks or video play automatically on your website. If you do have a clip playing automatically, ensure that it&#8217;s muted.</span></p>

It is a way to convert your traffic into a potential customer. From a client’s perspective, it&#8217;s a place to look for a job. Know your niche it will help you to get the right gigs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the previous article, we had discussions on the proposal, how it become attract clients for our organization. Now we will move further on job boards, which is another way to attract the client. Response to proposal gives us good contracts and new project opportunities. But they’re time exhaustive and time is very essential for our business. It is more important when you want to improve your revenue by getting multiple new clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this situation, you might prefer a third-party marketplace.  These platforms allow freelancers to bid on them and also has a list of potential client’s. This is a better option because here web developers can post their hourly rate and for a specific project type, they can be hired by clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are different kind of platforms which provide these facilities. Have a look at these following platforms.</p>
<h1><strong>Platforms to use Job Boards</strong></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #111111; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 27px;">Upwork</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upwork – work with someone perfect for your team</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></span></em> is a popular marketplace platform, previously known as Odesk where you can collaborate and connect with your business and individual professionals. It gives the option to place the bids on client projects. It will not allow posting your own services. Upwork is a great place for your business to find new and recurring clients. In simple terms, we can say it is a cost-effective and simple way for clients to hire, work with and pay freelancers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we will take a short discussion about how to attract clients on upwork. For this, you should focus on your profile, which works like pull for clients instead of push. Mention these three points in your profile which will make it attractive.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Define your Ideal Client with a narrow niche tends to your work.</li>
<li>Defines the problems that they face with respect to your niche.</li>
<li>What result you will give them, define it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t make a profile which is about who you are. A client will never pay for you, they will pay for this how you can solve their problems. So prepare a profile which is about clients problems, how you will solve those problems and give the result as they want.</p>
<h2><strong> Freelancer</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer</a></span></em> is similar to upwork which allows you to browse your relevant work and bid on projects. It provides two ways of services: projects and contests. The project allows placing bods on jobs whereas contests allow submitting a work with a payment amount.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To attract a client on freelancer you should follow three things to do.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>When a client post a project place the bid within an hour. Clients need a project filled fast because a bunch of generic Spam replies.</li>
<li>Test your profile, it will cost you money which is more than creative proposals.</li>
<li>Stay online when you apply for a project because clients may chat immediately with applicants. Active users also appear higher in search because they may choose someone else if you are not online.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong> PeoplePerHour</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/"><span style="color: #000000;">PeoplePerHour</span></a></em> is a UK based company which allow posting a job for how much per hour they’d charge to do it. It is a marketplace which is used to connect freelancers and small businesses to buy and sell their services all over the world.</p>

This might be a bad idea before but now Zeplin is here to help. It allows a developer to be a good designer by following the simple guideline. Before that every work that a designer has done end up in a flattened work. This happens because developers don’t share the same perspective as of designer and things start losing in the transaction. Now, this is saved by the Zeplin by translating Photoshop and Sketch file into a free Mac, Windows or Web-App. “The best part is that Zeplin provides a quick reference for the colors, dimensions, and fonts from your designs,” says James Stiff. It also creates color suggestions for you.</p>

This is based on the concept in the book “Atomic Design”. It explains that you should break your design into a small element as possible like an atom. Now you have to connect these atoms to make molecule or organisms. That will be reusable and bigger. But deep inside it is a static website generator that only stitches different component and make a UI. Not just this Pattern Lab holds more than that. It has an option to design things in a nested form. With this you can design in a structured manner, Pattern Lab comes with a device-agnostic viewport to help you make your website responsive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Working hard is a good thing but working smart is even better. If you are into web design then you might be interested into some tool those will help you with it. These tools are just extended hand of yours that will save you time. A better web design will bring your audience into a good streamline. We are sewing up all these from different tools from different lists. This is to get you the test of best on best web design tools. These are some tools those are free and some are paid. Some are online, some need installation but all of them are worth giving a shot.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Sketch- Exclusive Web Design Tool for Mac OS X:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5015 size-full" title="Sketch- Exclusive Web Design Tool for Mac OS X" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>When it comes to web design or UI design then Photoshop is a good tool to help you with. But when you want to save you time and giving you extra feature, Sketch should be your first choice. This application is exclusively for Mac. No windows version is available here. In recent time Adobe has introduced Adobe XD that was officially launched in October. Still, people prefer Sketch over Adobe products. The thing is that as the project file size increases, Photoshop starts to lose control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Photoshop can’t handle a large file with smoothness. But due to the design of Sketch being in full vector mode, its project file is comparatively small. Also, it does not lose control as the file size increases. Also, the sketch is much easier than the Photoshop with its minimalist interface. You will find a plug-in for everything in Sketch App. You still need Photoshop if you want edit photo but in UI and Web design Sketch is stepping ahead.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Adobe XD- Alternative for Sketch on Window:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5011 size-full" title="Adobe XD- Alternative for Sketch on Window" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>It is a vector design and wireframing tool by the Adobe. It made its official appearance in October. Before that is was on its Beta version in May. It has a drawing tool, non-static integration defining tool, mobile and desktop preview app and many more. The thing that makes it more useful is its preloaded content. One thing that you will love about it is that you can copy things from other Adobe app. Although Adobe XD do not replace Sketch but there is one problem that Sketch have. It is hard to believe that every web designer is working on OS X or simply Mac. Adobe XD is available on both and that makes file sharing flexible with it. You can cope with your team easily.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Figma- Available to All Web Designer Tool:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5014 size-full" title="Figma- Available to All Web Designer Tool" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Figma is another tool that is used to build a beautiful interface. This application allows multiple designers to collaborate in real time. The best thing about it is that it is available on all platform, web, Windows, Mac and Linux. You can take help from people within the application. Also, the designing on the Figma is comparatively quick. Many web developers are using this application for collaboration. As it is available on all popular platform it makes it easy to let the designing go on. If you are not able to find it then web application will help you here. Also, it is good for making landing page or other design frameworks. It can generate great designs easily for desktop, tablet and mobile.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff;">Affinity Designer- The Photoshop Killer:</span></strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5012 size-full" title="Affinity Designer- The Photoshop Killer" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Serif’s Affinity Killer has got his nickname ‘Photoshop Killer’. It has a good collection of dedicated web and graphic design tools. One thing that is like a bliss in Affinity is 1,000,000 zoom function. That helps you get so deep into your art. Especially when you are working on vectors. Photoshop has 32,000 zooms only that some time is not enough. Also, affinity allows going back 8000 steps. What Affinity did here is that they made a similar UI to Photoshop. So if you are new in this you can start designing so easily. Also, its affordable price makes it worth giving a shot.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Anime.JS- First Library for Web Design Tool in This List:</strong></span></h1>

CSS may have solved the some of their problems. But as the complication increases in the design libraries comes in handy. Anime.js is also a library that will help you with the SVG designs, CSS, individual transformations, DOM attributes and JS objects.

<h2><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;"><strong>Angular.js</strong></span></h2>
