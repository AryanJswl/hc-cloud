Many organization is moving to the cloud for application, service or infrastructure deployment. But cloud computing and service is a very broad concept to understand. It is important to understand the difference between these cloud services. Many companies use these services to accelerate their product development, offload work etc. This article is going to cover these three ‘as a service’ with their definition, difference and comparison.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>SaaS- Software as a Service:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/saas-development/" target="_blank">Software as a Service</a></strong></span> (SaaS) is one big part of the cloud service world. It spread so fast across businesses and it is still growing. SaaS is actually an application service that needs web-browser to run itself. No installation or setup or space in the system required. Still, some SaaS require plug-in support and installation to do some extra task. Third-party here manage the services, management and its deployment. For example, you can look at CRM app like Salesforce, cloud suites like Google Apps, DropBox and other. One of the good reasons to use this services is that it is cost-effective. SaaS service comes on the subscription basis. So you only pay till you need them. You don’t have to make a one-time big purchase.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>PaaS- Platform as a Service:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Platform as a Service (PaaS) may be less used than the SaaS but it has proved its worth in time. If you are into development PaaS provide you a platform to do make the custom application. The server, maintenance and updates are still controlled by the third party application. This allows developers to focus on the <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">software development</a></span></strong></span>. About the installation, OS, storage and infrastructure these will be controlled by the enterprise or third party. Application developed on the PaaS have components inherited from cloud service. So these developed software are high availability, tenancy and scalability. PaaS has several benefits that we can count on. Reduced amount of code to be done, migration of app and implementation of business policy are few of them.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure as a Service is same as purchasing or billing the utilities. With IaaS we can control the database center; compute, networking, storage on the consumption basis. It provides complete access to the networking, storage and other things to an enterprise. API or a dashboard is a way here to control all these service. By this way, an enterprise can control the services remotely, without even making a physical appearance at the datacenter. Thing that makes it opposite to SaaS and PaaS is its managing aspect. Here, for example, we can take Microsoft Azure, AWS (Amazon Web Service). With IaaS business will work on VM ware on someone else server instead of your own. This way your application will be available to anywhere your provider has a datacenter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ehorus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saas-solutions-featured.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4661" src="https://ehorus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saas-solutions-featured.png" alt="saas" width="847" height="446" /></a>SaaS is “Software as a Service”. This is having the service of a software whenever you want. All you need is an internet connection with good speed. It will create an environment around you to use the software. This software is somewhere in the network. As you get the browser you will get software in your system. You can use it and as the browser gets close the software will no longer exist. No need to install anything.</p>
<h4>Example of SaaS:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a better explanation, let&#8217;s talk about Gmail. It is just a mail sending and receiving service. Gmail is gets its service from the cloud server. These clouds stores all the user data. Now as you access it, it generates its interference into the browser. Now you get logged in, or register, use their services and then leave. Gmail doesn’t need to any installation on your system to work well. All you do is accessing the website that is actually working as a software. The browser only played a role to provide that software a platform to run.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How Can You Define SaaS?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SaaS comes with many other names like web application, browser software, on-demand software and other. Not just Gmail, it can be delivered as management software, payment software, travel details or banking software or browser games. In any way that is possible and get delivered to you. SaaS is usually a paid service for its access. This is just to license the product usage. The owner can also cloak services and support with any component.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Why is SaaS that important?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest advantage it gives is of its usage. You don’t need to store software, install it or upgrading it. All of this hassle is taken care of when on the cloud. Software get its self update while it is in cloud. All you require is a browser and an Internet connection. No more need to maintain software or hardware for it. There are several kinds of premium pay of SaaS. In subscription-model, you pay depending on your usage. You will only pay for only what part you are using.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another good thing about them is they are flexible and scalable. Your work can rely on these software with full belief of growth. Also, it is platform independent. You can access your data and function whenever you want and however you want. Why? Because they only need an OS dependency. They can freely run this on their system by getting an Internet access and a browser.</p>
