<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence</strong>. IN SILICON VALLEY,&nbsp;the new currency is artificial intelligence.Over the last few years, a&nbsp;technology called deep learning&nbsp;has proven so adept at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, and translating from one language to another, the titans of Silicon Valley are eager to push the state of the art even further—and push it quickly. The two biggest players are, yes, Google and Facebook.</p>



<p>It’s a big move, because while software platforms can certain make AI research easier, more replicable, and more shareable, the whole process is nearly impossible without powerful computers.&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence.</strong> If you want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence concept visit <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">.</span></p>



<p>At Google, this tech not only helps the company&nbsp;recognize the commands you bark into your Android phone&nbsp;and&nbsp;instantly translate foreign street signs when you turn your phone their way.&nbsp;Regularly working with images or audio takes can be taxing for consumer-grade equipment, and some types of artificial intelligence have to break down and learn from 10 million pictures in order to learn from them. The process, called training, requires serious computing power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This is how the modern tech world works.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Internet’s largest services typically run on open source software. “Open source is the currency of developers now,” says Sean Stephens, the CEO of a software company called Perfect. “It’s how they share their thoughts and ideas. In the closed source world, developers don’t have a lot of room to move.” And as these services shift to&nbsp;a new breed of streamlined hardware better suited to running enormous operations, many companies are sharing their hardware designs as well.</p>

For this purpose, Facebook bought Bloomsbury, a London based AI startup which is specialized in developing and extending machine learning and natural language processing methods. According to Tech Crunch (Tech News Website), Facebook has spent 23 to 30 million dollars to buy Bloomsbury.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How can an AI solve this problem?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5143" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />A very high percentage of people get news from Facebook and (Google-owned) YouTube and both of these major platforms are having troubles with handling the fake news. AI systems can evaluate how well a post’s text or a headline compares with the actual content of an article someone is sharing online. Another side AI systems can compare fake material to identified specific accounts, profiles or source websites. This can help a large number of people to avoid fake content and getting the real fact.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Facebook need an AI?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5144 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Facebook has a division named FAIR (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research) which is working on AI for better user experience. The main goal to have an AI is to improve natural language processing and preventing inappropriate content on  Facebook, Instagram, and its many other properties. Many times facebook acknowledged that with more than 2 billion active users it’s not an easy task to prevent fake news or material that violates Facebook rules. That’s why Facebook decided to acquire Bloomsbury.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What can Bloomsbury do for Facebook?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5141" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Bloomsbury is a British startup company that building an AI that reads text documents and answers questions about the content. In a simple way, this British company can help Facebook to further understand natural language processing and its applications. Earlier Bloomsbury co-founder Sebastian Reidel also helped to create a fake news investigator AI Factmata which can tackle misleading content on the web. So we can say that Bloomsbury is a Triumph card for Facebook to combat against content problems.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5142" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />The problems Facebook and Youtube are facing with fake news have alerted other tech companies and Microsoft is also trying to build trusted algorithms and stop false news. Microsoft wants that AI systems are needed to built in to augment human capabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Otherwise, human intelligence is the real key to resolve this issue. It’s important that when somebody sees a violent or inappropriate content then that person should investigate the information, not sharing that immediately. Facebook and other companies are doing their best but users should be sensible and wise about this problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently Facebook has found a new problem in their system that is live streaming of violent videos by users. People are using this feature in a very bad and nasty way. Facebook tried to work out on this with other online live streaming platforms. Then in recent day, Facebook decided to design its own chip with a self-learning AI to stop steaming of these violent videos. FB users live streamed murder, violent act and even suicide. That made the website’s this feature so much infamous. These are the most disgusting imaginable for anyone but still, people are using it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As to the solution of this problem Facebook came with a combination of AI system and human moderators. They will keep these video off the grid and AI will keep learning about it. No matter how much AI will learn but the human moderator will still keep its work going on. Facebook first tried to make this flagging-algo with other online platforms but now Facebook is developing its own AI hardware.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff;">But why a Chip to filter Live Steam Video with AI?</span></strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A hardware chip will make the system to use less computing power. That will significantly increase the faster algorithm execution. Looks like Facebook is making a good investment by making this AI chip. AI will be helped whole time by a human moderator. This AI will take 10 minutes to bring down any violent video. Some video may stay live for up to an hour but AI will find it and bring it down. Facebook will not just clear their name but they also will make it family-friendly again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the tool will improvise with the time then it will help society so much. As the serial-killers will have no audience then they might stop committing murder or perpetrators will stop doing suicides. These disgusting acts from these mentally sick people will fade with time. As the murderer will no longer be glorified there will be no reason for them to live stream.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But in what way Facebook will train its new AI is still a secret. How it is going to flag videos is unknown. Like the case happen back in 2017 when a police officer shot and killed Philando Castile. His GF streamed the whole incident on Facebook live. Facebook got confused with the situation and first deleted the video as a violent video. Then Facebook undid that and uploaded video back with the graphical content warning. After that Facebook again deleted the whole video ultimately. Facebook’s logic here was, the video about violence will be allowed only if it is raising awareness not celebrating it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, in theory, it might be possible that the new AI chip will remove every video that is related to violence. It will not matter is it is celebrated or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Social-Media.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4818" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Social-Media.png" alt="Social Media" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Social-Media.png 960w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Social-Media-300x169.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Social-Media-696x392.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Social-Media-747x420.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When anyone talks about social media reach, Facebook is the first name that came to mind. Facebook is always the centre of these kind of conversations. Also, it is one that came to mind when we talk about organic traffic. Organic reach of the Facebook is always center of topic whenever people talk about SMO. There are some theories that it is all because of money. Facebook wants you to invest in their campaign to increase reach. But the thing is it is not all about money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many discussion regarding this on the Internet. One that pulled our interest was a post of Brian Christiano. <span style="background-color: #ff0f93; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/future-danger-of-facebook-personal-data/" target="_blank">Everyone was questioning Fb</a></strong></span> for its organic traffic declining with time. The original question was:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>“</strong><span class="td_text_highlight_marker_blue td_text_highlight_marker" style="color: #00a6ed;"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Why is non-paid</span> <span style="background-color: #0077d9; color: #ffffff;">Facebook</span> <span style="color: #ffffff;">reach so bad?</span></strong></span></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span class="td_text_highlight_marker_yellow td_text_highlight_marker" style="color: #0060de;">It seems like a pay to win on <strong>Facebook</strong>, just wondered why it was so bad.</span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>”</strong></span></h2>
<p style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Brian explained this in very well manner on why the organic traffic is so bad. He said partially you can say that Facebook is into money now. But not fully, there is a thing called News Feed Algorithm. Facebook has adapted Google feed algo for their news feed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what does that mean? Should we make our post optimized? The answer is NO. Zuckerburg has already cleared about this that he wants to keep Facebook engaging. They want to show only engaging content to their users. So how this algo decide which post is engaging? Then answer is that when one page makes a post, Fb puts it into a small pool of page’s followers. They analyze the engagement rate in that small group of people. If it falls above their preset value it goes to other followers too else get declined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That small pool is only 2-5% of your current followers. So smaller your follower in number then it will become harder to get engaged with all your audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The one thing that brands don&#8217;t take into account is that the algorithm is rolling. So if your brand has posted poor content for a while and all of a sudden posts something theoretically awesome then FB knows historically your content sucks and it won&#8217;t widen the audience. This is why brands can cause so much damage to themselves by posting garbage or too much promotional nonsense. It hurts short term and long term.” &#8211; Brian Christiano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we can not basically blame Facebook alone here. They are also trying to keep up their quality just like us. Facebook is proving that they are best in social media and actually they are. Fb holds one of the best social media campaign and audience than other media.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Personalize-Data.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4741" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Personalize-Data.jpeg" alt="facebook" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Personalize-Data.jpeg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Personalize-Data-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Personalize-Data-696x464.jpeg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Personalize-Data-630x420.jpeg 630w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when people pointed their finger on Facebook that it is stealing our personal data. But no one paid attention to it. And now is more targeted than before. Most of the people have lost their faith in it. This campaign is named as #DeleteFacebook. Now if you take a look at the news, you will what is really going on. Some are not any more into it and some are trying to make way to save their personal data from it. Our team just made some reading and traveling to everywhere and gathered so much information. Let’s talk about them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Poisoning Data</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some people said that if you are about to <strong><span style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/why-facebook-organic-reach-is-falling-low-and-low/" target="_blank">delete your account</a></span></strong> on Facebook then stop. Before deleting your data, make it look like a garbage to Facebook. Kevin Matthew, a former system administrator said he has generated a script that will turn your data into a random generated data. This way before leaving you can protect your data. Because Facebook can still use it from their cache storage.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Big Names are Fading from Facebook</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tesla, Playboy have already left Facebook and some more are in the mood of leaving Facebook now. As we said because for them there is no trust left. <strong><span style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a></span></strong> made sure that every account associated with him and the company out from the Facebook. One person asked him to delete Instagram too but Elon said it is Ok on Insta.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Controversy</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the 9news Australia, every third person in Australia might be affected by the data controversy of Facebook. Their data like calls, messages may be tracked by the Facebook application. Facebook applications like Facebook Lite and Messenger have permissions to access Calendar, Call History log, Contact Details. Whether user using Android 6.0 or above have rights to deny these permissions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Blowing Target Ad</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Targeted ads use user data to make them appear at the right place. Facebook is now cutting all the third party ad company off in order to protect user data. Facebook took this step after that controversy of data that happened in recent time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Apple Coming Forward</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Cook recently said his words when the Facebook woes are on high. He mentioned to never use their user data to make profit or money. Everyone has rights to have privacy. Apple could have used user data but they didn’t instead they sell their software and hardware at a high price. This price justifies the quality and standard they are providing. Also, this is their way to make money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are many things like Firefox launching plugins that will stop data usage by Facebook, noobies playing smart by making changes in-app and other. But one thing to consider that this controversy has shaken everyone. And now it will be hard for Facebook to regain their trust. News companies might try to fit-in social media business by launching one of their own. But thing is that people will not trust anyone easily now.</p>
