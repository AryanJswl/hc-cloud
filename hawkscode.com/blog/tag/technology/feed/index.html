<p>In today’s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Reading the ebullient reports, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives. And admittedly, it’s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so “there” you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we’re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.</span></a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All technologies come with risks</strong></h2>



<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it’s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It’s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don’t just enrich those who create them.</p>



<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robotics</span></a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/what-is-internet-of-things/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;– three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we rethink risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab</strong>, we’re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it’s the individuals, communities and organizations – the constituents – who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.</p>

<p><strong>Quantum internet breakthrough could help make hacking a thing</strong>. The advent of mass working from home has made many people more aware of the security risks of sending sensitive information via the internet. The best we can do at the moment is make it difficult to intercept and hack your messages – but we can’t make it impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we need is a new type of internet:</h2>



<p> the quantum internet. In this version of the global network, data is secure, connections are private and your worries about information being intercepted are a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Our current way of protecting online data is to encrypt it using mathematical problem that are easy to solve if you have a digital “key” to unlock the encryption but hard to solve without it. However, hard does not mean impossible and, with enough time and computer power, today’s methods of encryption can be broken.</p>



<p>Entanglement is so useful that it is set to become a resource itself, like data or electricity or water. And the primary purpose of the quantum internet is to distribute and exploit this resource in the form of entangled particles.</p>



<p>Quantum communication, on the other hand, creates keys using individual particles of light (photons) , which – according to the principles of quantum physics – are impossible to make an exact copy of. Any attempt to copy these keys will unavoidably cause errors that can be detected. This means a hacker, no matter how clever or powerful they are or what kind of supercomputer they possess, cannot replicate a quantum key or read the message it encrypts.</p>



<p>There is a catch, however. Entanglement is relatively straightforward to produce — quantum optics labs all over the world can produce it more or less on demand. But it is fragile, hard to store and tricky to transmit.</p>



<p>That’s why quantum networks are so difficult to build. Almost any outside interference destroys entanglement. Sneeze and you lose it.</p>



<p>So much of the practical work involved in creating quantum networks is in purifying, storing and boosting entanglement as it travels over long distances.</p>

<p>In thi blog,&nbsp;<strong>Satellite technologies are a new frontier in global development</strong>. Once a luxury of governments alone, from the late 1990s satellites began to be privatised and now satellites of all sizes are shooting into orbit. The benefits for the world’s poorest, and for the planet, could be boundless, as long as their data is open to all.</p>



<p>That was in the late 2000s, when he was analysing satellite imagery as part of his undergraduate studies at Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology in Maharashtra state, India. And the computer analysis of a picture could take even longer. Sometimes Roy would start the analysis at night and it would still be running the next morning.&nbsp;<strong>Satellite technologies are a new frontier in global development.</strong></p>



<p>But civil society organisations and individuals are&nbsp;harnessing the technology&nbsp;in innovative ways, making it harder for countries to hide human rights abuses from the world. The ‘democratisation’ of the data coming from the skies could be a win for communities in lower-income settings.</p>



<p>Satellites are being used for everything from monitoring illegal fishing to tracking malaria, from supporting early warning systems in flood-prone nations to measuring crop yields and giving farmers advice on fertilisers. So, can satellite technology deliver the boost for development that it promises?<br>In this Spotlight, we consider whether satellites can help governments meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, in this crucial decade for development.</p>



<p>Applying satellite technology is not without its challenges: satellites are unevenly distributed among countries, meaning the poorest are reliant on being granted access; locating and educating remote and nomadic communities is no easy task; and programmes designed to combat development challenges can struggle to collect the reference data needed.</p>



<p>As the world faces the unprecedented challenge of dealing with COVID-19, researchers are working on models using satellite data that one day may help analysts predict pandemic outbreaks. Beyond that, whether satellites can fulfil their development potential will rely on their becoming the truly democratic tool they promise to be.
