<p><strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.&nbsp;</strong>Network troubleshooting tools are a necessity for every network administrator. When getting started in the networking field, it is important to amass a number of tools that can be used to troubleshoot a variety of different network conditions.</p>



<p>While it is true that the the use of specific tools can be subjective and at the discretion of the engineer, the selection of tools in this article has been made based on their generality and common use. </p>



<p>Following are the <strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ping</strong></h2>



<p>The most commonly used network tool is the ping utility. This utility is used to provide a basic connectivity test between the requesting host and a destination host. This is done by using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) which has the ability to send an echo packet to a destination host and a mechanism to listen for a response from this host. Simply stated, if the requesting host receives a response from the destination host, this host is reachable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracert/traceroute</strong></h2>



<p>Typically, once the ping utility has been used to determine basic connectivity, the tracert/traceroute utility can used to determine more specific information about the path to the destination host including the route the packet takes and the response time of these intermediate hosts. The tracert utility and traceroute utilities perform the same function but operate on different operating systems, Tracert for Windows machines and traceroute for Linux/*nix based machines.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ipconfig/ifconfig</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most important things that must be completed when troubleshooting a networking issue is to find out the specific IP configuration of the variously affected hosts. Sometimes this information is already known when addressing is configured statically, but when a dynamic addressing method is used, the IP address of each host can potentially change often.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nslookup</strong></h2>



<p>networking issues revolve around issues with Dynamic Name System (DNS) address resolution issues. DNS is used by everyone using the Internet to resolve commonly known domain names (i.e. google.com) to commonly unknown IP addresses (i.e. 74.125.115.147). When this system does not work, most of the functionality that people are used to goes away, as there is no way to resolve this information. The nslookup utility can be used to lookup the specific IP address(es) associated with a domain name. If this utility is unable to resolve this information, there is a DNS issue. Along with simple lookup, the nslookup utility is able to query specific DNS servers to determine an issue with the default DNS servers configured on a host.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DNS Lookup</strong></h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>DNS Lookup</strong>&nbsp;tool retrieves domain name records for the domain name that you provide. You can use this to help diagnose problems and see if the problem originates from the domain name server — if you cannot return a domain’s records, you’ll know where to begin troubleshooting!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;allows you to test the validity and reachability of an email address. It makes sure that the email is syntactically valid and that it is available via an SMTP server. If you’re trying to cull false email addresses from your email list or something similar, this tool will be helpful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTTP Headers</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5712" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The HTTP Headers tool allows you to see what headers are returned by a web server for a specific domain name or IP Address. If you notice odd behavior with your HTTP connections, you can use this tool to troubleshoot the top-level domain. Alternatively, you can use it to check for redirection — minimizing these optimizes any links you might be using.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>URL Encode Decode</strong></h2>



<p>If you need to include special characters in your URL, you’ll need to encode them so that the URL remains valid. You can do this with&nbsp;<strong>URL Encode</strong>. Conversely, if a URL contains special characters and has been encoded, yet you want to see it in a more human-readable form, use&nbsp;<strong>URL Decode</strong>&nbsp;to standardize the URL.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WHO IS  Search</strong></h2>



<p>If you are curious as to who the responsible party (or parties) is behind a domain name, the <strong>WHOIS query</strong> will allow you to query multiple domain registrars’ databases. If the owner has chosen to hide their information, you can nevertheless return forwarding information.</p>

All this happened in a very short time period. With the help of these tested and verified libraries, we got so much power in hand when it comes to web development Service. So many tools are nowhere those will help you with improved workflow. Also, the benefits are more when it comes to making a website responsive. With browser add-on and plugins, streamline to stream code we can do much more. Possibilities for making some great designs for a website are increased. But more the options, more the confusion. One who is new to it will always wonder on which one to use which not to. So for your convenience, we are making a list here that will bring clear image to it.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #333333;"><strong>Top 5 Website Development Service Tools</strong></span></h1>
<h2><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;"><strong>Sublime Text</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sublime-Web-Development-Service.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5001" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sublime-Web-Development-Service.jpg" alt="Front End, Web Design, Web Development, Service, Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sublime-Web-Development-Service.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sublime-Web-Development-Service-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sublime-Web-Development-Service-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Who doesn’t want to do a thing so quickly and get them done before time? Sublime do the same for you here. If you are a diehard developer and love to spend your +9 hours on editor then it is for you. Sublime comes with a very interactive and simplistic design. Also, it is so much efficient than the other tools. Another feature that ad up to its repo is simultaneous multiple editing. You can do the same editing at several selected places. This very first-rate code editor is most people’s first choice. It also comes with so many shortcuts on the keyboards. Time saved by these shortcuts sure do add up in your development.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;">Chrome Development Tool</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Chrome-Web-Development-Service.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4998" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Chrome-Web-Development-Service.jpg" alt="Front End, Web Design, Web Development, Service, Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Chrome-Web-Development-Service.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Chrome-Web-Development-Service-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Chrome-Web-Development-Service-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Testing things on the go and seeing changes hand to hand would be great for any front-end web developer. This service is provided to you by Google on Chrome. Here with it, you can make changes to HTML, JS, CSS and debug them. All these things will be done in real time. This is bundled in Safari and Chrome. These applications allow developers into internal of their applications. There are several features like timeline, error, network flow, performance, memory security and other consoles. These consoles will help you in knowing how your website is performing and what are the problems it is having. Google give updates in every 6 weeks. So try to stay connected with Google website and Developers Social channels.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;"><strong>jQuery</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jQuery-Web-Development-Service.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4999" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jQuery-Web-Development-Service.jpg" alt="Front End, Web Design, Web Development, Service, Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jQuery-Web-Development-Service.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jQuery-Web-Development-Service-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jQuery-Web-Development-Service-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>JS has been the first choice of front-end developers for a long time. They have been using it for navigating docs, animation and more. But it has its own problems. One, it is  complicated, lengthy, unreadable or unapproachable syntax.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2006, a small compact and easy version of the library was introduced jQuery. It is a cross-platform library that is simplifying the task for web developers. While using jOuery developers need to solve many functionalities on their own. But with that, it opens gate for more into making animation, navigation to docs or adding a plugin. The success of jQuery is clear with that it is installed on 65% of top 10 million websites with the highest traffic.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;"><strong>GitHub</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GitHub-Web-Development-Service.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4997" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GitHub-Web-Development-Service.jpg" alt="Front End, Web Design, Web Development, Service, Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GitHub-Web-Development-Service.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GitHub-Web-Development-Service-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GitHub-Web-Development-Service-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>GitHub is a version control system. More specifically a tool that will save you when screwing up in your projects. GitHub offered you a service where you can view any little changes that you have made and go back to that. So any from here mistakes will be just past and you can start like it never happened. It also has a big open source community that helps when you get stuck with code. It makes teaming up, sharing codes and solution sharing so easy. Not just that, it offers service like bug tracking, task Management and wikis for this.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;"><strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Twitter-Bootstrap-Web-Development-Service.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5002" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Twitter-Bootstrap-Web-Development-Service.jpg" alt="Front End, Web Design, Web Development, Service, Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Twitter-Bootstrap-Web-Development-Service.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Twitter-Bootstrap-Web-Development-Service-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Twitter-Bootstrap-Web-Development-Service-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Bootstrap is a UI framework developed by the team at the Twitter. It is used widely in designing UI. Now everyone is bored of those old designs, same old contained, that cropping button. A front-end developer needs to make new comprehensive designs from those old designs and scraps. With the help of bootstrap, developers offer a service of application in speedy and eased way. How? It cut down the length of code and time that you would have put into without it. It is a compilation of normalized stylesheet, object model building, adding JS plugin and plenty of other features.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #333333; color: #3366ff;"><strong>Other Website Development and Design Tools</strong></span></h1>
<h2><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;"><strong>Angular.js</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Angular-Web-Development-Service.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4995" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Angular-Web-Development-Service.jpg" alt="Front End, Web Design, Web Development, Service, Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Angular-Web-Development-Service.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Angular-Web-Development-Service-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Angular-Web-Development-Service-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>HTML is first stone of the building but you need other tools too to complete the house. One thing that HTML lacks is that it is designed for static website. If a website needs the dynamic change then HTML can’t do it alone. Here comes the Angular.js into the play. It is an open source web application framework. It makes a more readable, more expressive and quick to develop an environment for your application. This service is developed by Google. It is criticized as only useful for the bulky and messy code. But still, it is a lot more when it comes to web development service.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #333333;">Sass</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SAAS-Web-Development-Service.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5000" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SAAS-Web-Development-Service.jpg" alt="Front End, Web Design, Web Development, Service, Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SAAS-Web-Development-Service.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SAAS-Web-Development-Service-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/SAAS-Web-Development-Service-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>First thing that one learns in Front End Website Development Service is DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself). A DRY code is always the choice of the developers. But keeping code DRY is hard as CSS is not DRY. There are few code preprocessors those will keep eye on your repeating codes and Sass is one of them. An eight year old that’s the definition of the CSS preprocessor. It helps you in writing a future-proof code with keeping it dry and readable.</p>
