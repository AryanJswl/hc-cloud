<p>In this Article, you will get an introduction of Robotic Process Automation. RPA is a software technology based on software robots to perform certain Artificial Intelligence tasks like control Desktop applications, collect or gather data, store data to other applications, manipulate and modify data.</p>



<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) allows using software robots instead of people to drive the business. It enables you to automate regular tasks so that user can concentrate on complex tasks rather than routine work manually. This will leads to less chance of error and efficient work .</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Robotic Process Automation Examples</h2>



<p>RPA enables an business to make use of software robots to finish all  tasks within a given time. Helps to improvise the customer satisfaction. Robotic Process Automation is best suited for suited for processes that are clearly defined and well documented, repeatable without many changes and also if they are rules-based.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">RPA Architecture Components</h2>



<p>The architecture of any RPA tool is very complex and has multiple components. RPA is composed of the following main components:</p>



<ul><li>Authoring tool  includes workflow designs and recorder</li><li>Runtime environment includes RPA central, RPA Bot and Queue<ul><li>RPA Central</li><li>RPA Bot</li><li>Queue</li></ul></li><li>Self Service end-user interface<ul><li>Self Service X</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tools for RPA</h2>



<p>No matter what RPA software you use, its tools should have several capabilities. They should be able to automate multiple kinds of application environments, including Citrix, desktop, and web environments. List of few tools that are very commonly used.</p>



<p>UI Path</p>



<p><strong>Uipath</strong>&nbsp;was founded in 2005, and it is the most popular RPA automation tool in the current market.</p>



<p>The great thing about Uipath is that it provides a community edition to people who want to learn, practice, and implement RPA. Features of Uipath are:</p>



<p>Multiple hosting can host across multiple virtual machines and cloud. Compact-able applications work on desktop, mainframes, web apps.</p>



<p><strong>Automation Anywhere</strong></p>



<p>Automation Anywhere was developed in 2003 in San Jose. It is the leading RPA tool use globally. Easy to use require no programming skills. It is easy to integrate this with any platform.</p>



<p><strong>Blue Prism</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blue prism</strong>&nbsp;is capable of providing the virtual workforce powered by robots.&nbsp;It requires a deep knowledge of programming. It is more robust, secure based on java so work on OOPs concepts. Easy to scale based on the requirements.</p>



<p><strong>Work Fusion</strong></p>



<p><strong>WorkFusion</strong>&nbsp;was founded in 2010, and It is the packaged automation solution for all complex tasks combining into one platform. It is best for non-coders easy to drag and drop libraries.</p>
