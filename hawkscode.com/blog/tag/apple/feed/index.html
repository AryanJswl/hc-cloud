<p style="text-align: justify;">There was a time when people pointed their finger on Facebook that it is stealing our personal data. But no one paid attention to it. And now is more targeted than before. Most of the people have lost their faith in it. This campaign is named as #DeleteFacebook. Now if you take a look at the news, you will what is really going on. Some are not any more into it and some are trying to make way to save their personal data from it. Our team just made some reading and traveling to everywhere and gathered so much information. Let’s talk about them.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Poisoning Data</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some people said that if you are about to <strong><span style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/why-facebook-organic-reach-is-falling-low-and-low/" target="_blank">delete your account</a></span></strong> on Facebook then stop. Before deleting your data, make it look like a garbage to Facebook. Kevin Matthew, a former system administrator said he has generated a script that will turn your data into a random generated data. This way before leaving you can protect your data. Because Facebook can still use it from their cache storage.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Big Names are Fading from Facebook</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tesla, Playboy have already left Facebook and some more are in the mood of leaving Facebook now. As we said because for them there is no trust left. <strong><span style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ff1294; color: #ffffff;" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk" target="_blank">Elon Musk</a></span></strong> made sure that every account associated with him and the company out from the Facebook. One person asked him to delete Instagram too but Elon said it is Ok on Insta.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Controversy</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to the 9news Australia, every third person in Australia might be affected by the data controversy of Facebook. Their data like calls, messages may be tracked by the Facebook application. Facebook applications like Facebook Lite and Messenger have permissions to access Calendar, Call History log, Contact Details. Whether user using Android 6.0 or above have rights to deny these permissions.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Blowing Target Ad</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Targeted ads use user data to make them appear at the right place. Facebook is now cutting all the third party ad company off in order to protect user data. Facebook took this step after that controversy of data that happened in recent time.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>5. Apple Coming Forward</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tim Cook recently said his words when the Facebook woes are on high. He mentioned to never use their user data to make profit or money. Everyone has rights to have privacy. Apple could have used user data but they didn’t instead they sell their software and hardware at a high price. This price justifies the quality and standard they are providing. Also, this is their way to make money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are many things like Firefox launching plugins that will stop data usage by Facebook, noobies playing smart by making changes in-app and other. But one thing to consider that this controversy has shaken everyone. And now it will be hard for Facebook to regain their trust. News companies might try to fit-in social media business by launching one of their own. But thing is that people will not trust anyone easily now.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4649" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3.jpg" alt="android" width="1000" height="595" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3.jpg 1000w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3-300x179.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3-696x414.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3-706x420.jpg 706w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this much surprises in the smartphones, it is becoming hard to imagine what is next to see. With the iPhone’s notch everyone was amazed in the starting but now it is seen as uncool. So many android phones also have adapted this hardware styling for their phone. LG, Oppo, Huawei, Honor are those brands who quickly jumped into it. But what is to come after that will be again a surprise for all. All we can say right now is something amazing is going to happen but our team made some list what we might see more in 2018 in android devices.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">The Notch:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notch is the one update that comes to everyone’s mind when it comes to mobile design. Many companies have copied this notch update from iPhone X where some smart companies playing their own way. LG G7 and Asus ZenPhone 5 came with notch while maintaining the essential hardware in front, like camera, mic, speakers. This Notch game was first praised as the ‘Devil’s Horn’ but now everyone thinks of it as something cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While everyone was jumping into mud some stayed out of it. Samsung S9 and Google Pixel 2 came with the new update. They adopted a new way to increase body to display ratio. The solution here is ‘the stripe’. This was the way to makes unique identity while having the same functionality. This extra curvey screen is the solution here to increase body to display ratio. Samsung proved that notch is not the only solution to increase screen size. People are not looking for the Notch. Edge to edge screen that bezel give is far better than Notch.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Miniaturization:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hardware are hard to compress that is why when it came to edge-to-edge display phone companies adapted notch. But thanks to the miniaturization of the sensors and chips it is now possible to reduce that size of the plastic that holds your phone. Apple is been dreaming for decades to come up with an all screen phone. Notch is just one step toward that dream. Samsung and Sony have learned that notch is not that much appreciated. So they have reduced the size of the bezels. A compact bezel is a good solution for bigger screen also it is easy to use with one hand than the Notch.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Camera:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing that is making its appearance in most of the phone is a dual camera. It first came in iPhone 7 plus and Samsung made it into Galaxy 8. Now it is normal in 2017. Most of the phone are now coming with dual-camera. Motorola, LG, Oppo, Mi they are producing their phone with same. But what makes difference here is the image processing chip. It is the thing that gives you a quality. That&#8217;s why iPhone and One Plus’s dual-camera is the only thing that is praised by people. But Sony is now working on more sensitive image processing chip. So if we are looking into future of camera our bet on Sony.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Other Updates:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we talk about the locking the phone, iPhone came with the FaceID that use complicated 3D matrix. Then there comes Samsung with its Iris Scan before Apple’s FaceID. Then if we go with hardware beneath the skin then it is wi-fi android P comes with 802.11mc protocol support. That does better with indoor positioning. And At last OLED is the one behind edge-to-edge solution for the screen.</p>
