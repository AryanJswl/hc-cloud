<p><strong>DevOps&nbsp;</strong>is a new buzz in the world of IT. People interpret it as software but it is a&nbsp;<strong>concept</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>approach</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>methodology that combines software development and Information Technology to shorten the System Development Life Cycle.</strong></p>



<p>It is the offspring of agile software development, from the past few decades there is a need for a more holistic approach to the end to end Software Delivery Life-cycle. DevOps use the approach, practices and tools that increase an organization able to deliver Applications and Services at high velocity and throughput in comparison to the organization uses a traditional approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">chain of tools used commonly in<strong>&nbsp;DevOps environments</strong>.&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="991" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg" alt="What is DevOps" class="wp-image-5579" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-300x290.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-768x743.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1536x1486.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-696x673.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1068x1033.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-434x420.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Coding:&nbsp;</strong>Develop the code and review it, source code managing and merging tools.</p>



<p><strong>Building and Testing</strong>: These includes continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment tools with an emphasis on task automation. It also includes pre-deployment staging.</p>



<p><strong>Releasing:&nbsp;</strong>release approvals, release automation or deployment of software or applications</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring&nbsp;</strong>Other products to support DevOps include&nbsp;<strong>real-time monitoring</strong>&nbsp;and incident response systems, as well as collaboration platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes DevOps different from Agile?</strong></h2>



<p>So I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is DevOps?</strong>&nbsp;But what makes it different from previous methods like agile. The main difference is it works in real-time with more velocity that helps the development and operation team to get the updates and make changes efficiently according to customers and market needs which leads to<strong>&nbsp;Rapid Delivery</strong>&nbsp;of Products. Use practises like&nbsp;<strong>continuous integration</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>continuous delivery</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring and logging</strong>&nbsp;make this concept more &nbsp;<strong>reliable</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>scalable</strong>&nbsp;as is used for the cloud. Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>&nbsp;by using&nbsp;<strong>automated compliance policies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>fine-grained controls</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>configuration management</strong>&nbsp;techniques.</p>

<p>In todays topic we will discuss&nbsp;<strong>Drone technology uses and applications.</strong> Drones also known by the name Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Miniature Pilotless Aircraft or Flying Mini&nbsp;<strong>Roborts</strong>. Over the past few years drones demand is booming in market and is used for differenet industries. From quicky deliveries at rush hour to the unreachable military basecamp drones are proving extreamly usefull in places where man cannot reach. You can also learn through my new blogs the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/how-do-drones-work/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working of drones</span></strong>&nbsp;</a>and its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bit.ly/2Uzhsz0" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working without GPS</span></strong></a>.</p>



<p>Initially known for military use, drones are now being used by individual enterpreneurs. According to a study by the year 2020, 16 million drones will be sold in commercial markets of the world below you can see the&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drone technology uses and applications</strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aerial Photography</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are use to capture footage that would otherwise requires expensive choppers. No need of pilot. Easy to reach at anyplace small and compact in size which let it take magnifying pictures by getting close to the place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shipping and Delivery</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use for fast delivery of food, small packages, medicines, beverages, letters for smaller distance. Many companies like Amazon, UPS are in favour of using drones for shot disctance delivery it will save time a lot of man power, unecessary road traffic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disaster Management</strong></h2>



<p>Drones provide a quick report after a natural or man-made disaster geather information of injured people or the total distruction. Rescue people and provide them food, water etc.You can take a example of corona virus spread in china now they provide food and water to victams through drones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Geographic Mapping</strong></h2>



<p>Drones can acquire very high-resolution data and download imagery in difficult to reach locations like coastlines, mountain tops, and islands. They are also used to create 3D maps and contribute to crowd sourced mapping applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Agriculture</strong></h2>



<p>Drones use infrared sensors to detact the crop health, enable farmers to improve crop. This is a cheap and effective method for farmers to input fertilizers and pesticides.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weather Forecast</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use to forecast weather it can monitore unpredictable weather, Since they are cheap and unmanned, drones can be sent into hurricanes and tornados, so that scientists and weather forecasters acquire new insights into their behavior.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Military</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are used by military for reaching terrorist campgrounds and use in war as well.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So we were discussing the top 10 editor or android studio tools those will aid you in the <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com.au/technologies/Mobile-Application/Android-App-Development">application development</a></span></strong></span>. The service we got from these editors is like the enhancement to your development. In <a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/top-10-editor-or-tools-for-android-application-development-services/" target="_blank">last post we talked about 5 editors</a>, those were AVD manager, android device monitor, Unreal engine, Unity 3D and Android Debug Bridge. Now is the time for the next 5 editors to complete our list here. These next 5 editors also can be inbuilt or not into Android Studio.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;">Game Maker Studio for Android Game Development:</span></strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So if you are into game development then you can use this tool. It will help you in build 2D-game with effectively zero code. Yes for more customization you will have to go down to basic level to ‘Game Maker Language’. This is easier than Unity and Unreal Engine. But as you get things for lesser codes you get loose power and functionality. Also paying for no power and functionality is also not worthy. Yes, it is not free, it is a paid editor.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Start Application Development with Basic for Android (B4A):</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lesser known Android IDE that is needed when you are about to seriously go into application development. This IDE was developed by Anywhere Software. This IDE is fully focused on the rapid development of applications. For development, it uses BASIC language. For those who are not familiar with BASIC let us introduce you. BASIC is a simple language that read similar to the English. This programing language packs your application with several packages instead of making it stand alone. It allows you to do lots of things with JAVA and with more.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>AIDE (Android IDE)</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A unique IDE that is on the list. Why? Because it runs on the android itself. It is like in the way development. Now you can develop applications on your mobile or tablet. As something that moves from system to mobile, it misses so many features. The same thing happened with AIDE. It lacks so many features that Android Studio have. But plus point here is its editor and real-time testing, it is the real boon here. Highlighted code and simple tutorial are the big help in development.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Visual Studio with Xamarin:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visual Studio is the Microsoft’s IDE that supports different languages like C#, VB.net, JavaScript, more with extensions. As Xamarin comes bundled in, you can do cross-platform development with C#. It is free to use and you can test the application on the devices those are connected with the cloud. So if you are into development of a utility app then must use this. You will not have to write code twice or thrice for different OS and devices. The only negative point here is it has less Google Features and support.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #3366ff;"><strong>Eclipse:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the starting days of the Android development, Eclipse was the first choice of the developers. It is also a general IDE that supports multiple programming languages. Eclipse doesn’t support ‘Out of the box’ like the android studio. It also requires some more setups to get started. Now Google has dropped its support for Eclipse so now there is no big reason to select it over Android Studio. Also, do not go into development based on eclipse the tutorials now. These tutorials must be outdated and may be long gone. So move on and drop Eclipse.</p>

But if we had made this list without android studio then it would be a cheat. Android Studio is official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android that keeps you update. It has all the material designs that Google have updated itself with. We are listing here some more editors and tools that will help you with App development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Android apps are officially developed on Java, but now it also supports C++. And now Google has introduced its own language ‘Kotlin’. IDE just help you in compiling all the system and program file in an APK. This arranged file and program in an executable file for mobile. Now, this tool has additional tools too that comes in single download now. Android Studio is always the first choice for every developer.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00;"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Mobile Application Development with AVD Manager</span></strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AVD is a virtual simulation of android device. AVD stands for “Android Virtual Devices” It let you test the application into your system without installing it again and again in the physical device. This will help you know how well your design will look into most of the devices. Now you just need to test it on some popular devices and you are all set. This emulation software allows you to create different emulators for devices with different size and different version of OS. The performance will increase with the time, even more with the ‘virt mode’. This mode will run Intel version of the android to your device. Also, this will remove the instruction level emulation.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;">Android Device Monitor</span></strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is just like the task manager. It will keep you updated with the running status of the application. What kind of thread is using the network, how many processes, LogCat and other things? This monitoring tool is a built-in function that comes with Android studio. It is great for testing and performance monitoring.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #00ff00;"><strong>Android Debug Bridge</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a little one-line command that is useful in making communication with your device whether virtual or physical. ADB is a pre-installed feature of the android studio. It is very easy to use and needed frequently. As if you any tutorial you will find it each time. So as you start <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com.au/technologies/Mobile-Application/Android-App-Development/" target="_blank">android application development</a></strong></span> you need to open it. To open it you need to go to the installation folder and then open the platform-tools folder or any folder where you will find adb.exe and then open a command line there. To open command line press Shift + RMB then click open command line here.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Android Game Development with Unity 3D</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A game engine, that is popular with game developers. Unity keeps you out of a headache and problem of lengthy codes and time. It is possible to develop a game with Android Studio but its features surpass Studio. It is a cross-platform game development and IDE. One thing to consider is that does not comes in-built. You have to separately download it to your system. You can make Virtual Reality apps for VR devices like Cardboard, Gear VR and Daydream.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Unreal Engine</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another game engine that is superior to the Unity 3D. It provides easy support for the Android. If you are into full cross-platform application/ game development you can use this engine. But when it comes to better built-in support Unity 3D surpasses it. But it is up to you that you either choose Unity or Unreal. You should try at least both first before making any decision.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">When one thinks of coming up with a <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ff0080;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ff0080;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/" target="_blank">mobile application development</a></strong></span>, now it is not that simple than before. There was a time when there was a mare of applications in the market that made easy to stand out. But now there are thousands of applications build with same goals. So you can say that it is harder than before. Also making an app is costly and time-consuming too. But there are chances if you work with some plan you may achieve it with lesser cost and time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One need to be so particular about before stepping into application development. Making your applications are now more complex than before. To go with a systematic approach towards the applications development we have made some list so to help you in working on your application.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #00ccff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Imagination and Idea:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are into creative work imagination is must need part of it. One has to imagine why he/ she is making that application. What are problem sectors that your application is going to resolve? What will be the features of your application? This imagination should provide some tangling benefit to your customers too. You must keep coming to them with new solutions, new revenue and enhanced productivity.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #00ccff;"><strong>Market to be Targeted:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another step before starting the journey is to know the path you are walking in so can be prepared for anything that will come later. If you don’t know any single thing about your native market, it becomes hard to compete. First is that you should know who you are targeting. Not knowing your audience is a big disadvantage. It gives you clear vision toward your application. This is where your pitch come handy. All you need to do is blend all your ideas, vision, mission and imagination into two or three sentences. This must be catchy one that explains everything you are putting into your applications.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ccff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>A platform for Application:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to selecting what platform you are about to work then you must go with right choice as per business. This task is done with the analytic that you got when you researched your market. There is three choice you got; Native, Web, Hybrid. Choose one from these and they will help you in future maintenance and development.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ff0080; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Native:</strong></span> Have best UI but require better significant skills and time to develop.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ff0080; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Hybrid:</strong></span> Have a prebuilt native container with on-the-fly web coding to achieve best out of all.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #ff0080;"><strong>Web:</strong></span> It is quick and cheap and is developed in HTML 5, JS and CSS.</p>
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ccff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Track Your Self:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use an appropriate analytic tool for your application. Track how well they are performing. Analytic gives you a brief idea of how users are coming on your application. You can know how a user came to an app? What service are they using? Which one are they not? This analysis will come in handy when you are updating your application or bringing some changes as per your user&#8217;s behaviours. For this you can take help from these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytic</li>
<li>Flurry</li>
<li>Localytics</li>
<li>Mixpanel</li>
<li>Preemptive</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Web development is a major unit when you are into business. It plays a vital role if you are into expanding more or stable. The website remains with you all the time. So what a website perform for you:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a service showcase template that highlights what your company can do.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A website lists you online with public access on the most search engine.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a self-promotional practice.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Through the blog, you can share your opinion with the world.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is a service offering proposal with text and other media.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Services like SEO let you help see who and how your customer are performing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are just some little highlights what website can do. A business needs to have wed developer or support of <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development company</a></strong></span>. This support or collaboration may run for a long time but it is important. So when you select a company or web developer make sure you know them well. It not a one-time thing that you do and is done for all. It is a way of conversation with your customer and future clients.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Development never Ends:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a business asks “How long will it take to complete the website?”. Websites are rarely static now. Most of the data is dynamic and it is hard to complete while small things will keep on updating. So if small business keeps on asking when will it get done then answer is it will go on. It is not a one time process that gets done after a time. Language or technology it is developed on keeps on changing with time so do website need to be. To keep up with the trends and opportunity website development need to run time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now you need to invest wisely in this. You make sure that you don’t go with cheaper one to save money. As this is a long process it may be going cost in future. Also, don’t go with one with much price in first place. Make sure that you have a technical help like a friend or relative from the same background. Their review and knowledge will help you in choosing the right one for your business. Or you make contact with several developers or <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">website development company</a></strong></span>. Now you have a full information about them you can make a full analysis on your own. This will narrow down option for you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></span> are important in Website Development:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s suppose your website has all the functionality and working done perfectly. But, what is the point if it cannot attract users or make them stay. Here design and experience play a vital role. Designs are what attract your potential client. A good <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">Website design company</a></strong></span> will be a big help here. Still, you have to take care of some points those may harm your conversion with your client.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Large size media and content, like video and code, make your website heavy to load in the browser. That also slow downloading speed of a website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not put so much animation or heavy graphics that takes time to load. What is a good point in making a website that user doesn’t pay attention to? If your user doesn’t have good patience then he will move to another service provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All your content needs to be responsive and optimized. You can take help from <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/digital-marketing/seo/" target="_blank">SEO team</a></strong></span> to make sure that your website is well optimized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attractive is not enough, make it interactive and initiative. Your website must force your user to keep on browsing it and see all your service. A website must make impression on the user. They need to remember you for your services. It is the way make them return.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management is Necessary:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do development without any plan then it has more chance that you will fail at some points or you will make mistake. Make it possible that before starting a project you have a better plan for everything. If things go with a plan it goes in a very optimized way. It controls everything like cost, resources, content and other related things. Make sure that you are active at the current time. Being in a managed way will help you in managing the content of the website. By these update, a user will know how updated and managed you are. They know that you are available for users. Management help development team to do their work in very confident and in a comfortable manner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Web-development-Company-min-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Web-development-Company-min-2.jpg" alt="Web Development Company Australia" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Web-development-Company-min-2.jpg 1000w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Web-development-Company-min-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Web-development-Company-min-2-696x465.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Web-development-Company-min-2-629x420.jpg 629w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, actually one cannot decide which language is best for web development. What is best for one developer can be a crap for another web developer. It is just matter of skills set developer to have. If one developer has good skills with one language it is best for him. Development is basically based on the control over the language. To make development more beautiful one can use 2 or more different programming languages.</p>
<p>So let’s start our topic here with:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/php/" target="_blank">PHP</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP made its debut in mid-1990. It was a revolutionary application that made it possible for a website to have a dynamic data. Before this website used to be a bulk of static data but this changed it all. It made those boring website more interactive. PHP has one problem and that is a length of the code for small tasks. It requires a lot of code to make small tasks work on a website. After 2 decades there are many languages those can replace PHP. But still the PHP is ruling its place and most programmer still prefers this language.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">Java</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was never made for <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development</a></strong></span> or web applications but still, Java is said to be one of best programing language. Java had a different sole purpose, but still, get used in website development. Java is having a very long timeline so if you are into a project that will be altered by your people or other then use Java. Why? Because a basic developer knows Java well. Java’s sole purpose was never browser related development. So if you write code in Java your team will not need new to learns to make a change or maintaining code.</p>
<h3><strong>Go a.k.a. Golang:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This language is like an extension to any development language. It is flexible and easier than Java for web applications. Go is a general purpose language but not that popular. But it has an advantage when used for applications that work on parallel processing. This advantage increases its chances of being liked in future. So it will be a good option for you to do development of web application or other application.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/python/" target="_blank">Python</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Python was also not made for web development. But then Django (a python framework) made it all easy for developers. Due to this framework, a website developer can implement functionalities from python to a website. You can also use plain old Python to do application or web development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any experience into the development of the application, you know how hard it is to find a perfect developer. If you are thinking of saving some hundred or thousands of dollar by neglecting quality then you are making a big mistake. It is always hard when it comes to finding out a solution with <strong><a style="color: red;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/" target="_blank">mobile applications</a></strong>. So you need a right guide to choose a better developer. You should invest good, not much not less. But you should know better the app be greater the revenue will become.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer That Take Interest:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An Application Developer or development company should not just be making an app for you. But they should share their experience of making app into same domain. They should tell you what are users seeking into this kind of apps. What are the solutions they can provide you from their experience? A developer must take interest in your business or idea of applications.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What User Looks Into App:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The application developer must have a good experience in <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></strong></span> skills. You must check their portfolio. A user downloads an app only if they get impressed by the UI in the screenshot. Apps are all the show of attracting eyes of a user. If your app can’t make a good impression it will fail. Also if the app is failed in user experience, then the product will fail again. You need to impress the audience with the first attempt.</p>
<h3><strong>What Other says About Them:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one has that long life that will give them the experience of everything. You should remember that they have experience into this. That means they have some clients too. Try to get reviews from those who have worked with them before. Reviews will help you in sorting out the right one for you without any hassle.</p>
<h3><strong>Go Through Full App Lifecycle:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An app developer should keep working on the application throughout its lifecycle. Choose someone who can be there with an app whole time. Company or developer should not abandon the app just after it is completed or hosted. Applications need to evolve with time to time. This evolution is based on the reviews given by the user.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality will Pay You in Long Term:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you are into <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/android-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>application development</strong></a></span> you should make sure that you are with good one. You are here to make a good product so don’t go with some cheap one. Don’t make saving money is your only goal here. Yes, no one comes with a great budget but still, you need to make a decent investment in the app. Mobile Apps are long-term running projects and cheap investment will break it before your estimated life cycle.</p>
<h3><strong>Be with a Team:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project is done by a team where everyone has their own role to play. Everyone is expert in their own field. So never go with a sole developer. He may make a better performing application but not a good UI and UX. Why? Because it is not his cup of tea. Have a team while doing development or have a good company that will provide you with every asset regarding the application development.</p>

This will be just waste of the fuel. You are basically wasting your resources. This very thing happens when you are into mobile UI and UX. When you don’t know what problem lies in it then how are you going to solve them? All you need here is to detect the problem, define them. We are into <a href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/" target="_blank">mobile application development</a> for more than 6 years. We have designed many mobile UI and UX at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we have learned here from our experience is that you need a follow-up plan before narrowing down your problems. You need to prepare a plan that does not limit your innovation and imagination. You need to be more creative with your solution than the product itself. We must not stop our possibilities. This streamline will help you with all the problems you are about to solve. Let&#8217;s talk about them in brief.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Perspective of User:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know what UI means, User Interface, so why we lack user perspective in making one. We need to think of it form the user’s end. For that, we have to put on user’s shoes and then see the UI. Here the user is what all that matter.</p>
<h4>Setting Up the Definition:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you started thinking as a user then you must take out the problems, point to point. It will be a report documented with all the problem that a user will face. Let&#8217;s say if your app’s interface is too much simple that user of 17-22 age group will not find it attractive. And if they didn’t take interest in the app how is it going to last in market.</p>
<h4>Do it with your Team:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teamwork is what always pay you better. Make a team let them use your application. Now this will create a vantage point for the same UI. You will find many little and big problems in that. This will save your time and efforts. This is like pointing out on the map now all you need is to connect all these dots and find your way.</p>
<h4>Problem Statements are the Solution:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These statements are the solution here. All the thing you are going to take need to be action oriented. These problems must be focused on the methods you are using to make goods. Go with your team and get their solution point to point but they need to be narrow. If you are focusing on the broad area then there is no point in that. Like if the point is “UI is not attractive.” Then there will be only waste of time and resource because you are going to change the whole UI. But one needs to point out what part makes it unattractive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Same happens when it comes to the making them too narrow. Like “Change Font Style, It is not visible.” What will that do is making you paranoid over font style. It will stop you from thinking that you can replace them with icons those are more understandable. This way you can save your resources easily. Not just it, you can also try questioning your UI and UX. Ask then “Why” and you will make good profit.</p>

But now it is used for the development of many different applications and solutions like system administration, database control, administration panel. Back then most of the people were used to be designers. It is right now one of the major development languages. But now people are moving toward making every new website as a SaaS. Here we will make discussion on how to make better web and application development with PHP.</p>
<h4>Use Core PHP Function and Classes:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a better and fast development of the website or application, one can take advantage of predefined functions. These functions are defined to make sure perform some task. All you need to do you is that just call them when you need them. You don’t need to waste your time on the development of your own function. Check the manual before making any new function.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">File for configuration:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can generate a whole single file for the configuration. This will work as a master file. If you need any configuration need to be done then you only need to do that into one file. So that you will need to do that same thing into several different files. This will help in maintaining the code and will make it more modular.</p>
<h4>Error Reporting:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one good thing if you accept your mistakes. Remember you should always keep the error reporting when you are doing the development. This ‘White Screen of Death’ is one thing that will help you improve and maximize your potential. error_reporting&#8217; and &#8216;display_errors&#8217; these will be your two friends in development.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We used to do comments in our code to make it more understanding for other and of self. But do not overdo this practice. A good code is self-explanatory. You need to be more better at making well managed code. Comment only complicated part of your code. Your code need to have a simplicity for understanding.</p>
<h4>Editor need to be Handy:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An editor needs to be good. Your editor need to be a feature rich. These feature should help you with your development and making it more easy. Making yourself comfortable with a handy editor will make the development process more flexible.</p>
