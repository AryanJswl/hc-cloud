<p>In this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss</strong>. In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I’ve heard it all:</p>



<ul><li>“You can’t have privacy if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have security if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t get upgrades if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have a good user experience if you use Android!”</li><li>“YOU CAN’T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!”</li></ul>



<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;</em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I’m here to tell you they’re all equally misguided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now, don’t get me wrong:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a&nbsp;<em>nugget</em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we’re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don’t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don’t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).</p>



<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself — as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform — overlooks one key point. It’s a foundational reality of Android that’s been at the system’s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches</strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app’s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</strong></p>



<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner — that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;an “Android way” — not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.</p>



<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it’s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Same level of choice and control</strong></h2>



<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world’s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.</p>



<p>It’s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story — the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choice and control within Android</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll start with privacy — an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn’t actually that it’s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It’s simply that Google’s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don’t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it — at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.</p>



<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults — and most people aren’t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What’s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide</strong>; it’s just up to you to embrace it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>What about security? Well, it’s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources —&nbsp;<em>the horror!</em>&nbsp;— but, y’know, it’s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they’ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It’s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>That brings us to the realm of updates — both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It’s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion</strong></h2>



<p>The Pixel, as I’ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It’s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company’s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be — a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn’t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it’s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>to make. There’s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone’s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities — and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Android and iOS</strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates ’em. Neither platform’s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.</p>

Today, approx 60% of the customers look for a product online. So, E-commerce websites are emerging as the key player in the World Economy. Online presence of a product widens the customer range and makes you 24&#215;7 available. But, without deploying a proper <strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/e-commerce-solutions/">e-commerce solution</a></span></strong>, everything mentioned above remains a dream only. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Today, E-commerce Websites can be made in less than one hour, but just having a website is not enough. For the enterprises and Business, it is not so easy to fill their pockets online. The Basic requirement of an E-commerce platform is to list their products on their website, accept online payments and collection of information for shipping of products. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">We can sell the products online in two ways either by developing our own E-commerce website or selecting a Marketplace to do so. Both have their own pros and cons. Entrepreneurs and Businessmen are always in the state of confusion to choose between the two e-commerce solutions. Whether to develop their own websites or selling products with the affiliation of other famous marketplaces.</span></span></p>
<h2><strong>How to select the best eCommerce solution</strong></h2>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Choosing a Marketplace</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Choosing a third party website which contains various products listing in different product categories is known as selling products in a marketplace. Some of the famous marketplace websites are <span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a></span>, <span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://ebay.in/">eBay</a></span>, <span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://walmart.com/">Walmart</a></span>, etc. The concept is similar to starting a physical shop and taking a place for rent in a renowned mall. The benefit of this approach is that you save your penny on marketing. Because, the mall is famous and a big crowd comes there daily, so you will automatically have some percentage of that crowd to your shop resulting in increased sales. But, there are some drawbacks also, you will have to follow the rules and regulations of the mall. Apart from paying the routine rent, you will also have to pay commision to the mall at every sale you made. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Similarly to sell a product online in a marketplace, There are some advantages and disadvantages. If you are in association with a famous website, you will receive a heavy traffic on your product without doing its marketing. But, the major drawback is that you will not get the details of the customer to whom you are selling your products. Because they are the customers of the marketplace, not yours so you do not get the contact details. Due to this, You are not building the customer relationships and if that particular platform removes you from their listing, you will lose your online existence. Hence, selecting Marketplace may be easier for short-term business but it becomes very costly if you want to do long-term business.</span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>Having Your Own E-commerce Website</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Selling Your Products Over your own E-commerce website adds the wings of freedom to your Business. You have total control over your Product. It allows to select the custom style of product listing and give a unique experience to the customers. You can directly interact with the customers and create your brand awareness. Building a proper customer relationship gives the advantage of iterative selling to the same customer. The margin of profit is according to you. But, the other dark side of having own website is that it becomes very tough to drive traffic to your website. If we talk about efficiency in terms of cost, then having the own website may be expensive in the initial phase but it is seller friendly for long term Business. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Building the website does not require rocket science but just building a static information page is not enough. Deploying proper and latest technology for website development and design is a mandatory part of an ideal E-commerce solution. Further proper android and ios application for the platform act as a catalyser in improving the reach. After the platform is ready, you require marketing. Especially, there is a strong need for Search Engine Optimization(SEO), Social Media Marketing, Email Marketing etc.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You can do these things by yourself if you have a tech background. But hiring a <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com">web design company</a></strong></span> who also provides the service of Digital Marketing is always the best option. Some of the <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/it-consulting/">IT service companies</a></strong></span> provide you with the best IT solution. This support makes you free to focus upon your Products. Note it that proper website design, android app development, payment gateway integration and <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/digital-marketing/">Digital Marketing Services</a></strong></span> add wings to your E-commerce Business and can make you a Millionaire. Hence, Select the companies who have the team of experienced professionals in each of these domains. After having such an IT support, you are all set to start your Online store.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The selectivity of choosing an E-commerce solution depends upon the type of product and the associated sector. Both the marketplace and own website have its own pros and cons. However, Having your own website with an ideal IT support is always a better and long-term sustaining Decision.</span></span></p>

It feels great when the education institute takes the future of their students seriously and do anything that is within their reach to benefit these students. A few days back JEC College, Kukas, Jaipur approached us to conduct a workshop on IT technologies. This workshop will be like a light on the choice they will make in future, to awake these students in what tech they are good. In my opinion, the workshop is a really important part of a student life.</p>
<h2><strong>Little Light on 2 Day Workshop</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is like an opportunity that was brought to our door to be a part in shaping the future of these students. Our team decided to conducts this workshop for 2 days on August 10, 2018 and August 11, 2018.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were surprised with the energy that those students were having and that warm welcome we received was an amazing experience. This much students taking participation was a great thing. Seeing those bright eyes looking forward to us for the skills and experience we have gained in all these years. It is really a hard exercise to put all your into a 20-page slide but we have to do it very efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our three mentors took three different classed on different technology, one was PHP, one iOS and one android. Only getting knowledge from the book is not enough, this is still a big problem in The Indian Education system. Students are thought with the books but for their better future, they need industrial touch in their study. To give that internship and workshop are best practices.</p>

HawksCode team has conducted workshop another day successfully.

<p style="text-align: justify;">They had knowledge of these techniques and how they work but all this was limited to the book. We know this industrial knowledge do not come into exam but it gives them a third perspective. This helps them in solving complex problems in the future. And after this workshop, you can clearly see the confidence they now have to be in an IT Industry soon. Again it was an amazing experience for both the students and us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So we were discussing the top 10 editor or android studio tools those will aid you in the <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com.au/technologies/Mobile-Application/Android-App-Development">application development</a></span></strong></span>. The service we got from these editors is like the enhancement to your development. In <a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/top-10-editor-or-tools-for-android-application-development-services/" target="_blank">last post we talked about 5 editors</a>, those were AVD manager, android device monitor, Unreal engine, Unity 3D and Android Debug Bridge. Now is the time for the next 5 editors to complete our list here. These next 5 editors also can be inbuilt or not into Android Studio.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;">Game Maker Studio for Android Game Development:</span></strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So if you are into game development then you can use this tool. It will help you in build 2D-game with effectively zero code. Yes for more customization you will have to go down to basic level to ‘Game Maker Language’. This is easier than Unity and Unreal Engine. But as you get things for lesser codes you get loose power and functionality. Also paying for no power and functionality is also not worthy. Yes, it is not free, it is a paid editor.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Start Application Development with Basic for Android (B4A):</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A lesser known Android IDE that is needed when you are about to seriously go into application development. This IDE was developed by Anywhere Software. This IDE is fully focused on the rapid development of applications. For development, it uses BASIC language. For those who are not familiar with BASIC let us introduce you. BASIC is a simple language that read similar to the English. This programing language packs your application with several packages instead of making it stand alone. It allows you to do lots of things with JAVA and with more.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>AIDE (Android IDE)</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A unique IDE that is on the list. Why? Because it runs on the android itself. It is like in the way development. Now you can develop applications on your mobile or tablet. As something that moves from system to mobile, it misses so many features. The same thing happened with AIDE. It lacks so many features that Android Studio have. But plus point here is its editor and real-time testing, it is the real boon here. Highlighted code and simple tutorial are the big help in development.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Visual Studio with Xamarin:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Visual Studio is the Microsoft’s IDE that supports different languages like C#, VB.net, JavaScript, more with extensions. As Xamarin comes bundled in, you can do cross-platform development with C#. It is free to use and you can test the application on the devices those are connected with the cloud. So if you are into development of a utility app then must use this. You will not have to write code twice or thrice for different OS and devices. The only negative point here is it has less Google Features and support.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #3366ff;"><strong>Eclipse:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the starting days of the Android development, Eclipse was the first choice of the developers. It is also a general IDE that supports multiple programming languages. Eclipse doesn’t support ‘Out of the box’ like the android studio. It also requires some more setups to get started. Now Google has dropped its support for Eclipse so now there is no big reason to select it over Android Studio. Also, do not go into development based on eclipse the tutorials now. These tutorials must be outdated and may be long gone. So move on and drop Eclipse.</p>

But if we had made this list without android studio then it would be a cheat. Android Studio is official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android that keeps you update. It has all the material designs that Google have updated itself with. We are listing here some more editors and tools that will help you with App development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Android apps are officially developed on Java, but now it also supports C++. And now Google has introduced its own language ‘Kotlin’. IDE just help you in compiling all the system and program file in an APK. This arranged file and program in an executable file for mobile. Now, this tool has additional tools too that comes in single download now. Android Studio is always the first choice for every developer.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00;"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Mobile Application Development with AVD Manager</span></strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AVD is a virtual simulation of android device. AVD stands for “Android Virtual Devices” It let you test the application into your system without installing it again and again in the physical device. This will help you know how well your design will look into most of the devices. Now you just need to test it on some popular devices and you are all set. This emulation software allows you to create different emulators for devices with different size and different version of OS. The performance will increase with the time, even more with the ‘virt mode’. This mode will run Intel version of the android to your device. Also, this will remove the instruction level emulation.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;">Android Device Monitor</span></strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is just like the task manager. It will keep you updated with the running status of the application. What kind of thread is using the network, how many processes, LogCat and other things? This monitoring tool is a built-in function that comes with Android studio. It is great for testing and performance monitoring.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #00ff00;"><strong>Android Debug Bridge</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a little one-line command that is useful in making communication with your device whether virtual or physical. ADB is a pre-installed feature of the android studio. It is very easy to use and needed frequently. As if you any tutorial you will find it each time. So as you start <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com.au/technologies/Mobile-Application/Android-App-Development/" target="_blank">android application development</a></strong></span> you need to open it. To open it you need to go to the installation folder and then open the platform-tools folder or any folder where you will find adb.exe and then open a command line there. To open command line press Shift + RMB then click open command line here.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Android Game Development with Unity 3D</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A game engine, that is popular with game developers. Unity keeps you out of a headache and problem of lengthy codes and time. It is possible to develop a game with Android Studio but its features surpass Studio. It is a cross-platform game development and IDE. One thing to consider is that does not comes in-built. You have to separately download it to your system. You can make Virtual Reality apps for VR devices like Cardboard, Gear VR and Daydream.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Unreal Engine</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another game engine that is superior to the Unity 3D. It provides easy support for the Android. If you are into full cross-platform application/ game development you can use this engine. But when it comes to better built-in support Unity 3D surpasses it. But it is up to you that you either choose Unity or Unreal. You should try at least both first before making any decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4649" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3.jpg" alt="android" width="1000" height="595" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3.jpg 1000w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3-300x179.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3-696x414.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Android-3-706x420.jpg 706w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With this much surprises in the smartphones, it is becoming hard to imagine what is next to see. With the iPhone’s notch everyone was amazed in the starting but now it is seen as uncool. So many android phones also have adapted this hardware styling for their phone. LG, Oppo, Huawei, Honor are those brands who quickly jumped into it. But what is to come after that will be again a surprise for all. All we can say right now is something amazing is going to happen but our team made some list what we might see more in 2018 in android devices.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">The Notch:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Notch is the one update that comes to everyone’s mind when it comes to mobile design. Many companies have copied this notch update from iPhone X where some smart companies playing their own way. LG G7 and Asus ZenPhone 5 came with notch while maintaining the essential hardware in front, like camera, mic, speakers. This Notch game was first praised as the ‘Devil’s Horn’ but now everyone thinks of it as something cool.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">While everyone was jumping into mud some stayed out of it. Samsung S9 and Google Pixel 2 came with the new update. They adopted a new way to increase body to display ratio. The solution here is ‘the stripe’. This was the way to makes unique identity while having the same functionality. This extra curvey screen is the solution here to increase body to display ratio. Samsung proved that notch is not the only solution to increase screen size. People are not looking for the Notch. Edge to edge screen that bezel give is far better than Notch.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Miniaturization:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Hardware are hard to compress that is why when it came to edge-to-edge display phone companies adapted notch. But thanks to the miniaturization of the sensors and chips it is now possible to reduce that size of the plastic that holds your phone. Apple is been dreaming for decades to come up with an all screen phone. Notch is just one step toward that dream. Samsung and Sony have learned that notch is not that much appreciated. So they have reduced the size of the bezels. A compact bezel is a good solution for bigger screen also it is easy to use with one hand than the Notch.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Camera:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another thing that is making its appearance in most of the phone is a dual camera. It first came in iPhone 7 plus and Samsung made it into Galaxy 8. Now it is normal in 2017. Most of the phone are now coming with dual-camera. Motorola, LG, Oppo, Mi they are producing their phone with same. But what makes difference here is the image processing chip. It is the thing that gives you a quality. That&#8217;s why iPhone and One Plus’s dual-camera is the only thing that is praised by people. But Sony is now working on more sensitive image processing chip. So if we are looking into future of camera our bet on Sony.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Other Updates:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we talk about the locking the phone, iPhone came with the FaceID that use complicated 3D matrix. Then there comes Samsung with its Iris Scan before Apple’s FaceID. Then if we go with hardware beneath the skin then it is wi-fi android P comes with 802.11mc protocol support. That does better with indoor positioning. And At last OLED is the one behind edge-to-edge solution for the screen.</p>
