It feels great when the education institute takes the future of their students seriously and do anything that is within their reach to benefit these students. A few days back JEC College, Kukas, Jaipur approached us to conduct a workshop on IT technologies. This workshop will be like a light on the choice they will make in future, to awake these students in what tech they are good. In my opinion, the workshop is a really important part of a student life.</p>
<h2><strong>Little Light on 2 Day Workshop</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is like an opportunity that was brought to our door to be a part in shaping the future of these students. Our team decided to conducts this workshop for 2 days on August 10, 2018 and August 11, 2018.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We were surprised with the energy that those students were having and that warm welcome we received was an amazing experience. This much students taking participation was a great thing. Seeing those bright eyes looking forward to us for the skills and experience we have gained in all these years. It is reallyÂ a hard exercise to put all your into a 20-page slide but we have to do it very efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our three mentors took three different classed on different technology, one was PHP, one iOS and one android. Only getting knowledge from the book is not enough, this is still a big problem in The Indian Education system. Students are thought with the books but for their better future, they need industrial touch in their study. To give that internship and workshop are best practices.</p>

HawksCode team has conducted workshop another day successfully. The students got <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/certificate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#certificate</a> of participation and our mentor team was honored by JEC Group Of Colleges to share a part of their <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/skills?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#skills</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/experience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#experience</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/students?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#students</a>. <a href="https://t.co/5qu7YyQKAg">pic.twitter.com/5qu7YyQKAg</a></p>
<p>â€” HawksCode (@HawksCode) <a href="https://twitter.com/HawksCode/status/1028869061990526978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They had knowledge of these techniques and how they work but all this was limited to the book. We know this industrial knowledge do not come into exam but it gives them a third perspective. This helps them in solving complex problems in the future. And after this workshop, you can clearly see the confidence they now have to be in an IT Industry soon. Again it was an amazing experience for both the students and us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, actually one cannot decide which language is best for web development. What is best for one developer can be a crap for another web developer. It is just matter of skills set developer to have. If one developer has good skills with one language it is best for him. Development is basically based on the control over the language. To make development more beautiful one can use 2 or more different programming languages.</p>
<p>So letâ€™s start our topic here with:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/php/" target="_blank">PHP</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP made its debut in mid-1990. It was a revolutionary application that made it possible for a website to have a dynamic data. Before this website used to be a bulk of static data but this changed it all. It made those boring website more interactive. PHP has one problem and that is a length of the code for small tasks. It requires a lot of code to make small tasks work on a website. After 2 decades there are many languages those can replace PHP. But still the PHP is ruling its place and most programmer still prefers this language.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">Java</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was never made for <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development</a></strong></span> or web applications but still, Java is said to be one of best programing language. Java had a different sole purpose, but still, get used in website development. Java is having a very long timeline so if you are into a project that will be altered by your people or other then use Java. Why? Because a basic developer knows Java well. Javaâ€™s sole purpose was never browser related development. So if you write code in Java your team will not need new to learns to make a change or maintaining code.</p>
<h3><strong>Go a.k.a. Golang:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This language is like an extension to any development language. It is flexible and easier than Java for web applications. Go is a general purpose language but not that popular. But it has an advantage when used for applications that work on parallel processing. This advantage increases its chances of being liked in future. So it will be a good option for you to do development of web application or other application.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/python/" target="_blank">Python</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Python was also not made for web development. But then Django (a python framework) made it all easy for developers. Due to this framework, a website developer can implement functionalities from python to a website. You can also use plain old Python to do application or web development.</p>

But now it is used for the development of many different applications and solutions like system administration, database control, administration panel. Back then most of the people were used to be designers. It is right now one of the major development languages. But now people are moving toward making every new website as a SaaS. Here we will make discussion on how to make better web and application development with PHP.</p>
<h4>Use Core PHP Function and Classes:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a better and fast development of the website or application, one can take advantage of predefined functions. These functions are defined to make sure perform some task. All you need to do you is that just call them when you need them. You donâ€™t need to waste your time on the development of your own function. Check the manual before making any new function.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">File for configuration:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can generate a whole single file for the configuration. This will work as a master file. If you need any configuration need to be done then you only need to do that into one file. So that you will need to do that same thing into several different files. This will help in maintaining the code and will make it more modular.</p>
<h4>Error Reporting:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one good thing if you accept your mistakes. Remember you should always keep the error reporting when you are doing the development. This â€˜White Screen of Deathâ€™ is one thing that will help you improve and maximize your potential. error_reporting&#8217; and &#8216;display_errors&#8217; these will be your two friends in development.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We used to do comments in our code to make it more understanding for other and of self. But do not overdo this practice. A good code is self-explanatory. You need to be more better at making well managed code. Comment only complicated part of your code. Your code need to have a simplicity for understanding.</p>
<h4>Editor need to be Handy:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An editor needs to be good. Your editor need to be a feature rich. These feature should help you with your development and making it more easy. Making yourself comfortable with a handy editor will make the development process more flexible.</p>
