<p>In today&#8217;s blog we are going to talk about Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It. Jordan Walke, a former employee at Facebook, developed ReactJS. It’s an open source JavaScript library that is utilized to create user interfaces for single page apps.</p>



<p>Since it requires only a minimal understanding of HTML and JavaScript, React has risen in popularity as a front-end web development tool.</p>



<p>Without reloading web pages, developers can make certain changes in web app data. The features or purpose of this is to be easy, efficient, and quick in making a user interface for apps.</p>



<p>Here is : Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thing which is exceptional about React JS</strong></h2>



<p>It can be easily guessed that React is not similar to other popular frameworks, like Angular or Ember. So unlike others, it is, in fact, small, developed on the concept of components and functions properly with other frameworks as well as libraries such as JQuery, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rich User Interface</strong></h2>



<p>In this era, customers expert more then static HTML website from you. It is important to provide quality without load time, performance and other factor. React Js gives you everything you need to build web applications with rich user-interfaces that can promise exceptional user experiences. User-interfaces being very crucial for the success of your business, you can easily build cool UI using declarative components.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reusable Components</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img decoding="async" width="875" height="492" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g.png" alt="Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It " class="wp-image-5693" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g.png 875w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-300x169.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-768x432.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-696x391.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-747x420.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" /></figure>



<p>React provides a component based structure. You start with tiny components like button, checkbox, dropdown etc. and the you create wrapper components composed of those smaller components. And then you write higher level wrapper components. And, it goes on like that until you have this one root component and that component is your app.</p>



<p>Each component decides how it should be rendered. Each component has its own internal logic. This approach has some amazing results. You can re-use components anywhere you need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Testing and Functionality</strong></h2>



<p>Developers can use the ReactJS framework for browsing ecmascript6 modules that define reliance and can utilize it with Babel, reacts-di, etc. These are simple to test and can be treated as the present state’s function.</p>



<p>They can be monitored from the triggered functions, output, events, etc. You need to test prior to using and React JS definitely makes it very easy for doing it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ease of Migration</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike Google’s Angular framework, which had faced a very alarming compatibility issue between version 1.x and 2.0, the ReactJS library supports a wide range of codebases and can be mixed into any existing infrastructure without shutting down the system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="b01b">Clean Abstraction</h2>



<p>One of the powerful sides of React is that it provides a good abstraction which means that it does not expose any complex internals to the user.</p>



<p>Compare this to Angular: Why on earth should you have to learn an internal process such as digest cycles? Those kind of details better be kept as internals to provide a clean abstraction. You only need to understand a component’s life cycles, states and props to master React to accomplish everything you need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strong community support</strong></h2>



<p>Like Angular, React also has very strong community support, which is one of the main reasons to adopt React JS in your project.</p>



<p>Every day, a large number of individual React developers are contributing towards making React a better frontend framework. Currently, React JS has attained 136.079 starts on Github and 1,331 regular contributors.</p>

But as of Google 2019 rule for the search result has been made some points clear we can think that there are many points those will affect your website’s rank in a different manner.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Google Improving Its Algo For Ranking:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google has been improving its search engine, the number of details on your website that Google’s algorithm looks at has grown substantially. These details include the text and some of the dangling threads of information used to program your site.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Great amounts of research have been conducted to determine what these factors are and to what extent Google places value on each element. The results are ultimately educated guesses at best.  Google tells the world very little about how it ranks websites, at least not directly.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Does Google Ranking Work in 2019?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google uses a variety of factors in its algorithm to determine what results will be the most helpful for the user. It also uses latent semantic indexing, which uses search intent as an indicator of what results are the most relevant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google built its current algorithm around RankBrain, a machine learning (AI) algorithm Google uses to help sort and improve the search results. Backlinko condensed it pretty well:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">In short, RankBrain tweaks the algorithm on its own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Depending on the keyword, RankBrain will increase or decrease the importance of backlinks, content freshness, content length, domain authority, etc. Then, it looks at how Google searchers interact with new search results. If users like the new algorithm better, it stays. If not, RankBrain rolls back the old algorithm.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_5404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5404" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-5404 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png" alt="How Web Desing can Affect Your Search Engine Ranking" width="1024" height="387" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-300x113.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-768x290.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-696x263.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5404" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Backlinko</figcaption></figure></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The reason for this is because one search term can have hundreds of meanings. For example, if I conduct a search for the word “bathroom,” Google has no idea of what I’m really looking for. Possible results could range wildly, including:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Finding the nearest public restroom</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Defining what a bathroom is</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Emergency Plumbing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Bathroom remodeling companies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">News stories</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Home decor websites</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Cleaning advice</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bad design will hurt your SEO</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Someone goes online and searches for an answer, a service, or a product, and it leads them to your website. Sweet!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>…But</strong> <strong>suppose</strong> they choose not to engage with your content because of poor design. It’s too hard to read, too ugly, too complicated. They’ll return to the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) to find a better answer to their query.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop-ups:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Pop-ups can be useful, but serve as a pain point for your online audience, especially if they haven’t accessed any of your content yet. Use them sparingly, and not as soon as someone arrives at your site. Generally, you need to build trust with your audience before making an ask for their contact information or a commitment like subscription sign up.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illegible text:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you’ve chosen a font that is too small, too hard to read, or is presented as part of an offensive color scheme, people will not stick around to decipher your messaging. Using a readability tool will help you ensure that your text is always a delight for your visitors to read.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loud sounds:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;">You should never make audio tracks or video play automatically on your website. If you do have a clip playing automatically, ensure that it&#8217;s muted.</span></p>
