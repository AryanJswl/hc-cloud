<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, actually one cannot decide which language is best for web development. What is best for one developer can be a crap for another web developer. It is just matter of skills set developer to have. If one developer has good skills with one language it is best for him. Development is basically based on the control over the language. To make development more beautiful one can use 2 or more different programming languages.</p>
<p>So let’s start our topic here with:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/php/" target="_blank">PHP</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP made its debut in mid-1990. It was a revolutionary application that made it possible for a website to have a dynamic data. Before this website used to be a bulk of static data but this changed it all. It made those boring website more interactive. PHP has one problem and that is a length of the code for small tasks. It requires a lot of code to make small tasks work on a website. After 2 decades there are many languages those can replace PHP. But still the PHP is ruling its place and most programmer still prefers this language.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">Java</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was never made for <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development</a></strong></span> or web applications but still, Java is said to be one of best programing language. Java had a different sole purpose, but still, get used in website development. Java is having a very long timeline so if you are into a project that will be altered by your people or other then use Java. Why? Because a basic developer knows Java well. Java’s sole purpose was never browser related development. So if you write code in Java your team will not need new to learns to make a change or maintaining code.</p>
<h3><strong>Go a.k.a. Golang:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This language is like an extension to any development language. It is flexible and easier than Java for web applications. Go is a general purpose language but not that popular. But it has an advantage when used for applications that work on parallel processing. This advantage increases its chances of being liked in future. So it will be a good option for you to do development of web application or other application.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/python/" target="_blank">Python</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Python was also not made for web development. But then Django (a python framework) made it all easy for developers. Due to this framework, a website developer can implement functionalities from python to a website. You can also use plain old Python to do application or web development.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any experience into the development of the application, you know how hard it is to find a perfect developer. If you are thinking of saving some hundred or thousands of dollar by neglecting quality then you are making a big mistake. It is always hard when it comes to finding out a solution with <strong><a style="color: red;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/" target="_blank">mobile applications</a></strong>. So you need a right guide to choose a better developer. You should invest good, not much not less. But you should know better the app be greater the revenue will become.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer That Take Interest:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An Application Developer or development company should not just be making an app for you. But they should share their experience of making app into same domain. They should tell you what are users seeking into this kind of apps. What are the solutions they can provide you from their experience? A developer must take interest in your business or idea of applications.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What User Looks Into App:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The application developer must have a good experience in <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></strong></span> skills. You must check their portfolio. A user downloads an app only if they get impressed by the UI in the screenshot. Apps are all the show of attracting eyes of a user. If your app can’t make a good impression it will fail. Also if the app is failed in user experience, then the product will fail again. You need to impress the audience with the first attempt.</p>
<h3><strong>What Other says About Them:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one has that long life that will give them the experience of everything. You should remember that they have experience into this. That means they have some clients too. Try to get reviews from those who have worked with them before. Reviews will help you in sorting out the right one for you without any hassle.</p>
<h3><strong>Go Through Full App Lifecycle:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An app developer should keep working on the application throughout its lifecycle. Choose someone who can be there with an app whole time. Company or developer should not abandon the app just after it is completed or hosted. Applications need to evolve with time to time. This evolution is based on the reviews given by the user.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality will Pay You in Long Term:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you are into <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/android-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>application development</strong></a></span> you should make sure that you are with good one. You are here to make a good product so don’t go with some cheap one. Don’t make saving money is your only goal here. Yes, no one comes with a great budget but still, you need to make a decent investment in the app. Mobile Apps are long-term running projects and cheap investment will break it before your estimated life cycle.</p>
<h3><strong>Be with a Team:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project is done by a team where everyone has their own role to play. Everyone is expert in their own field. So never go with a sole developer. He may make a better performing application but not a good UI and UX. Why? Because it is not his cup of tea. Have a team while doing development or have a good company that will provide you with every asset regarding the application development.</p>
