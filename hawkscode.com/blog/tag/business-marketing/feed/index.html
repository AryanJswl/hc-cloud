<p>In this blog, I am going to talk about What is Sales Funnel and Sales Model? How you can boost your business, reach to right audience, Generate Leads and definately make profits. So in today&#8217;s world everything is digitally available and Sales Funnel is a core concept of&nbsp;<strong>Digital Marketing</strong>. To be successful in this Digital world your business need to showcase the product and services you provide and how your business is unique, how you add value.</p>



<p>A sales funnel is a marketing concept that maps out the journey a customer goes through when making any kind of purchase. The model uses a funnel as an analogy because a large number of potential customers may begin at the top-end of the&nbsp;sales process, but only a fraction of these people actually end up making a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can Reach Right Audience for your Business?</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sales Funnel is divided into multiple Steps</h2>



<p>Sales funnel is divided into multiple steps, which differ depending on the particular sales model. One of the most common ways of dividing a sales funnel possesses seven phases including:</p>



<p><strong>Awareness Phase</strong> Inn which prospects become aware of the existence of a solution.</p>



<p><strong>Interest Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects demonstrate interest in a product by conducting product research.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects or prospect companies examine competitors’ solutions as they inch toward a final buying decision.</p>



<p><strong>Decision Phase</strong>&nbsp;– In which a final decision is reached and negotiation begins.</p>



<p><strong>Purchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which goods or services are purchased.</p>



<p><strong>Reevaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in B2B sales it’s common for offerings to involve contracts that need to be renewed. As a customer becomes familiar with an offering, and especially as a contract draws to a close, a customer will enter a reevaluation phase during which they’ll decide whether or not to renew their contract.</p>



<p><strong>Repurchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which a customer repurchases a product or service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing each Stage of sales process</h2>



<p>Optimizing your website, facebook ads, sales funnel plays an important role to increase traffic, leads and Both marketing teams and inside sales managers commonly adopt strategies, tools, and tactics aimed at optimizing each stage of their sales process.  To reach out the audience you need right tools for it and a right Digital Marketing team who can help you out with this. </p>

Brand building is very important when you want to make sure that everyone knows you. It helps you in coming up with something extra within this competitive market. Branding simply defines you in front of your audience. It simplifies understanding of your audience about what services and products you are offering to them. Branding let your audience know you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The foundation of your brand is your logo. Each entity of your website should be represented by your logo. Moving back into time, branding was all about slogan, name, sign and symbol. Combination of all these helps people to identify who you are and what you do. It is said that ‘Brand’ and ‘Branding’ need to keep evolving with the time. It is a moving target that changes with the time so you need to evolve your brand too.</p>
<h3>Why we need Branding in Marketing?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The brand is what appears when you do the marketing and it is the only thing. It is base on which your whole marketing is standing. Branding is like a promise you are making to your customers. Before jumping into the marketing you should make sure that you have done some serious research on the market. You can say that branding is a strategic practice and marketing is tactical. Marketing is what you got as the result of branding.</p>
<h3>How can you define your Brand?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Defining your brand is like finding a definition of self. Your brand needs to be self-defining. It is tough and harder than the marketing. It is a time-consuming process that requires you to give some answers for your business.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the mission of your company?</li>
<li>Are you targeting right audience?</li>
<li>What are the uniques features, service and product in your business?</li>
<li>What does your Brand reflect in value for your customer?</li>
<li>What your customers are already thinking of you?</li>
<li>What quality do you want from them to associate with your family?</li>
</ul>
<p>After defining your brand all you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a brand-defining logo.</li>
<li>Create a good message for your business.</li>
<li>Write a perfect slogan or tagline for business.</li>
<li>Integrate your brand with everything you do.</li>
<li>Create a “Face” of your brand that will do all the explanation and conversion.</li>
<li>Create branding materials like templates, banner or others.</li>
<li>Do branding with consistency.</li>
</ul>
