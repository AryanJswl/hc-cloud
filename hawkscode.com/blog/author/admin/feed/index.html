<p>Content takes up quite a lot of space when one has to analyze the importance of all the elements that make up the web of SEO techniques. Anyone who has been associated with Search Engine Optimization knows that content is always the king. It plays a pivotal role in establishing your website’s authority and pushes your site to a rank on Google’s SERPs, where it has the convenience of visibility. Of course, that is not all that a site requires to be ranked on Google; there are several other metrics. But, what we mean to point out with this is that content occupies a significant amount of space in the entire domain of SEO. And that is why it is extremely important to market the content well. There is no point developing the content of your website without putting in the required amount of research. The point is simply lost on the developers then. We shall, therefore, look into what content marketing is, and also look into all the ways in which you can go about your content marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>So What Exactly Do We Mean By Content Marketing?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Content marketing is the process of creating content in the most relevant way possible, as a means to grab the required attention from Google and the target audience. That is the simplest definition of this digital marketing technique. And since it involves the term ‘marketing’ in it, it is clear that content marketing aims at marketing the content in the best way possible. However, it is not done just with the intention of selling a particular idea or acquiring conversions and new leads. Content marketing, in some cases, also aims at enlightening the target audience about some product, service or issue. In a nutshell, content marketing is the technique of adding some kind of value to your customers and enhancing their user experience. Once you are able to improve the user experience, your website gets recognized by Google, and you can then up your rank on the search engine’s results page. Several guest posts, which are a great SEO hack, also use the same content marketing trick to make business. And the best part of this entire process is that, you can always&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://serpninja.io/guest-posts/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">buy guest posts</span></strong></a>&nbsp;from a good SEO agency and ease up on the process of content marketing to find a suitable rank on Google.</p>



<p><strong>What Are Some of the Best Ways of Content Marketing?</strong></p>



<p>There are several ways in which you can market your content. And in this section, we shall be discussing on the all those ways so that the next time you go about the process, you can do so with enough knowledge on your side.</p>



<p><strong>Understand the Market Well-</strong></p>



<p>It all begins with acquiring holistic information on the market in which you are competing. Content marketing requires you to dive deep into the market and analyze your competition. How else do you presume to understand the pulse of the market? Look at all the factors that drive your competitors and see how they have been acquiring leads and conversions. Check their websites for loopholes in their content so that you can use the knowledge to your benefit. Understanding the market is the first step to content marketing, and you must do it well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5495" width="572" height="382" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png 451w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Target the Right Keywords-</strong></p>



<p>The next step is to target the right keywords so that you do not stray away from your market. You must invest a good deal of effort in researching the right keywords in your niche. Targeting the right keywords in your niche shall help you develop content in a way that will help you optimize for the search engines and create content that adds value to the search of your users. And that is how you are going to end up at a higher rank on the SERPs. Keyword research is an integral and perhaps the most important part of the entire content marketing process, and it is essential that you pay quite some attention to it. If you go wrong here, you will go wrong in other places too.</p>



<p><strong>Develop Content-</strong></p>



<p>Now that you have targeted the right keywords, what you must do is create content around those keywords, and you must do it well. The better you target your keywords and create content around them, the better will you be able to grab Google’s and your user’s attention. But remember that it is not enough to just add keywords for the heck of it. You must optimize the content well in every other way. For instance, you can add multimedia so that it adds more contexts and enhances the user experience.</p>



<p><strong>In a Nutshell:</strong></p>



<p>Content marketing is not as difficult as it seems. You can always end up creating the right content for your website if you know how to go about the process. All you have to do is invest time and effort in research and come up with innovative ways to optimize your content. That should just do the trick.  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://enticehq.com/blog/content-development/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">The 7 step Content Development Process to Grow</span></a></p>

<p>As we all know that all the globe is in Lockdown due to novel coronavirus, the pandemic. Most of the public sector and private services are in Lockdown and if you think information technology is free from it then You are wrong……</p>



<p>Most of the top companies in the <strong>IT (Information Technology)</strong> sector including <strong><a href="http://www.hawkscode.com">HawksCode</a></strong>, <strong>Infosys</strong>, <strong>Wipro</strong>, <strong>TCS</strong> and many more were gone under lockdown for the last few months and still don&#8217;t know the future.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>&#8220;THE IT SECTOR IS THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC BONE OF ANY COUNTRY&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>The economy </em></strong>is the most dangerous issue in the world during covid_19 and for cop-up with this most of the IT, firms decided to apply for <strong>work from home on their employees</strong>. </p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>But now the question is what type of technology we use amid covid_19.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Technology plays an important role in the world and now in the time of lockdown, its role is more important. We have discussed some points on how to use technology during lockdown especially in the <strong>Information Technology</strong> sector. </p>



<ol><li><strong>Use Skype &#8211; </strong>Skype is one of the best ways to be in touch with your clients and employees during the lockdown, one can communicate with others and share all the information and details with one another.</li><li><strong>Zoom &#8211; </strong>Zoom is another platform where one can conduct video conference or so-called <strong>webinar</strong> for meetings and conferences. </li><li><strong>Google Drive &#8211; </strong>Google drive is one of the best ways to share your data with others, it is the free source provided by Google. </li><li><strong>Artificial Intelligence  (AI) &#8211; </strong>This New Technology is the best way to deal with work without human efforts. Many devices nowadays are accessible to most of our efforts.. Few examples like Alexa, Google voice, eco, etc.. </li><li><strong>Cloud Computing &#8211; </strong>It&#8217;s the old trend now to save all the data in files and brochures, now most of the data have been stored in cloud only. It is the best way to store data and one can access the data from anywhere in the world.</li><li>Broadcast &#8211; broadcast is the fastest way to share the details and data with the employees, so in mid of lockdown, the broadcast will play an important role. </li></ol>



<p><strong>Coronavirus</strong> is the most dangerous pandemic in the world now., it is spread already across the globe and economy is affected by it. So the information technology sector plays an important role.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Factors that Affect SEO</h2>



<p> So now you know what is SEO and how it works. Take a look at both on-page and off-page factors that impact search engine results page rankings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Content Marketing</h3>



<p>Content marketing is the most effective way of attracting search engines and helping you to make connections with your website visitors.</p>



<p>Writing quality content will help your website in many ways. The more relevant and quality content it is, the more likely search engines will be to rank your pages higher on SERP.</p>



<p>Similarly, the more effective and engaging your content is, the more visitors will spend some quality time on your website which may convert into a purchase.</p>



<p>You should write content including your keywords. Try to focus on long-tail keywords at first as they are good at the beginning. Content should not be copied from other websites and completely describing your business or product. Incomplete information leads to misconceptions.</p>



<p>Types of content you can publish and improve your search engine rankings:</p>



<ul><li>Articles and blog posts.Videos and audio</li><li>Social media content</li><li>Infographics</li><li>How-to Guides and Tutorials</li><li>Other visual content</li></ul>



<p> Creating fresh content is key. Fresh content does not mean that you have to write daily but it means that you can repost your previous blogs. Edit them or update them and make it fresh for your audience. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. On-Page SEO</h3>



<p>On-page SEO refers to all the practices done on the web pages in order to rank them higher on search engines. In simple words, all the elements which happen on your website come under on-page SEO. Content marketing is not the only factor but it also consists of your website&#8217;s HTML.</p>



<p>You have complete control over your website&#8217;s on-page SEO.</p>



<p>Have a look at some important on-page SEO factors that can help you improve your search engine ranking:</p>



<p><strong>Title Tag&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> The title of your page tells what your page is about. Your title should be of 50-70 characters with space. The primary keyword should be present in the title before the separator. An eye-catchy title will help you in getting traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Meta Description&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> It is basically a summary of your page. It tells search engines and human visitors about your page. The meta description should not be more than 160 characters and its optimum length is 125 characters. The focus keyword is very important in the Meta description.</p>



<p><strong>Sub-headings&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> Your page should contain several headings. Headings not only make your content easy to read but it also helps your website&#8217;s SEO. You can use many heading tags like H1, H2, H3 and so on. Under one heading don&#8217;t write more than 300 words.</p>



<p><strong>Image Name and ALT tags&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> People do not consider it important but it is as much important as other things are. If you are using images in your blog post then adding keywords in the image name and alt attribute helps search engines to index your image for a particular keyword.</p>



<p><strong>Internal Links&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> Internal links help search engines to know more about your site. Internal linking means linking within the website. Link your other products or services within your blog.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Off-Page SEO</h3>



<p>You will have complete control on on-page SEO but here on off-page SEO, you don&#8217;t have any direct control. Still, you can improve it in some ways. Work done for your website on other websites is known as off-page SEO in easy terms.</p>



<p><strong>Some off-page SEO factors for your website:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Social&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> One important factor is social signals, such as likes and shares. It&#8217;s easy for you if you get some quality shares on your content. It will make you reach much wider.</p>



<p><strong>Links&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> The most popular way in off-page SEO is crating backlinks of your website. It will boost your SEO very easily. You should be very careful while creating backlinks as your website can get spammed very easily because of this method. Build links on good websites having a good SEO score.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Black Hat vs. White Hat SEO</h4>



<p>There are two different approaches that companies have to take for optimizing their sites for the search engines.</p>



<p>Black hat SEO focusses on optimizing content only for search engines and not for human visitors. It may help in ranking on search engines very quickly but they often get banned by search engines.</p>



<p>White hat SEO is the opposite and it involves optimizing for the human audience that will be reading and clicking the site&#8217;s content. It&#8217;s a more effective tactic in the long run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How SEO works for small Businesses: Final Outcome</h2>



<p>Now you know how SEO works, you can easily optimize your website and boost your rankings on search engines.</p>



<p>Always remember that there are a lot of factors that impact the SEO of your site but providing the right content to the relevant audience is most important. SEO is not magic as it does not shows its results overnight. It may take months to show results.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">At precisely exactly the exact identical time, Google will lengthen the time that it implements reviewing apps for your Play Store in situations where there is a programmer </span><span data-contrast="auto">not known to this business.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Google notes at a programmer blog post that, &#8220;We shall shortly be taking additional hours (days, not months) to examine apps by programmers which don&#8217;t have a track listing.&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">The review procedure that is lengthier may allow it to tackle the growing wave of apps which make it into the Play Store. Apple clarifies that generally, 50% of apps are examined in 24 hours and more than 90 percent have been examined in two days.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Google will try to create life painful for Android programmers after the crackdown on SMS and Phone Log permissions of a year. Google claims its enforcement campaign has led to a 98 percent decrease in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">number</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of apps using consumer info that is sensitive.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">The rules simply allow apps selected option for making calls or sending text messages. The crackdown resulted in apps falling performance or confronting a ban on distributing the program via the Google Play Store.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">The crackdown was declared by google as part of Project Strobe, its own endeavor to enhance the security of consumer information after finding a bug at Google+ which subjected 500,000 consumers&#8217; information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Developer concerns center on three important topics complaints which Google took to provide responses about appeals and reviews; and also, the feeling that there were not any humans.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">To deal with these issues, Google is promising more communication info about allure and tests, and placing people.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;People, not bots, previously examine every sensitive choice, but we&#8217;re advancing our communication so answers are far more personalized &#8212; and we&#8217;re expanding our staff to help hasten the appeals procedure,&#8221; Google says.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Google is currently enabling programmers to &#8220;instantly&#8221; attraction instances where a programmer account was blocked. Each appeal will likely probably be &#8220;carefully assessed by somebody on the staff&#8221;, according to Google.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Google cubes accounts for acute, repeated breach of its own policies and notes </span><span data-contrast="auto">which &#8220;bad</span><span data-contrast="auto">-faith programmers&#8221; attempt to skip it by opening new accounts using different programmers&#8217; accounts to release dangerous apps. To protect against these programmers out of gaming the system, Google does not discuss the reasons.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

But as of Google 2019 rule for the search result has been made some points clear we can think that there are many points those will affect your website’s rank in a different manner.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Google Improving Its Algo For Ranking:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google has been improving its search engine, the number of details on your website that Google’s algorithm looks at has grown substantially. These details include the text and some of the dangling threads of information used to program your site.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Great amounts of research have been conducted to determine what these factors are and to what extent Google places value on each element. The results are ultimately educated guesses at best.  Google tells the world very little about how it ranks websites, at least not directly.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Does Google Ranking Work in 2019?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google uses a variety of factors in its algorithm to determine what results will be the most helpful for the user. It also uses latent semantic indexing, which uses search intent as an indicator of what results are the most relevant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google built its current algorithm around RankBrain, a machine learning (AI) algorithm Google uses to help sort and improve the search results. Backlinko condensed it pretty well:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">In short, RankBrain tweaks the algorithm on its own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Depending on the keyword, RankBrain will increase or decrease the importance of backlinks, content freshness, content length, domain authority, etc. Then, it looks at how Google searchers interact with new search results. If users like the new algorithm better, it stays. If not, RankBrain rolls back the old algorithm.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_5404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5404" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-5404 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png" alt="How Web Desing can Affect Your Search Engine Ranking" width="1024" height="387" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-300x113.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-768x290.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-696x263.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5404" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Backlinko</figcaption></figure></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The reason for this is because one search term can have hundreds of meanings. For example, if I conduct a search for the word “bathroom,” Google has no idea of what I’m really looking for. Possible results could range wildly, including:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Finding the nearest public restroom</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Defining what a bathroom is</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Emergency Plumbing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Bathroom remodeling companies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">News stories</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Home decor websites</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Cleaning advice</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bad design will hurt your SEO</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Someone goes online and searches for an answer, a service, or a product, and it leads them to your website. Sweet!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>…But</strong> <strong>suppose</strong> they choose not to engage with your content because of poor design. It’s too hard to read, too ugly, too complicated. They’ll return to the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) to find a better answer to their query.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop-ups:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Pop-ups can be useful, but serve as a pain point for your online audience, especially if they haven’t accessed any of your content yet. Use them sparingly, and not as soon as someone arrives at your site. Generally, you need to build trust with your audience before making an ask for their contact information or a commitment like subscription sign up.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illegible text:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you’ve chosen a font that is too small, too hard to read, or is presented as part of an offensive color scheme, people will not stick around to decipher your messaging. Using a readability tool will help you ensure that your text is always a delight for your visitors to read.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loud sounds:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;">You should never make audio tracks or video play automatically on your website. If you do have a clip playing automatically, ensure that it&#8217;s muted.</span></p>

The physical devices can join with almost any other, and it may happen anywhere including home appliances, smoke alarms, or some other device that is on the web or another device in some manner. The &#8220;thing&#8221; in the Internet of Things is a natural or manmade object which will be given a unique IP address and can exchange data according to certain predetermined rules. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The Internet of Things is a trending topic and it has-rapidly found significance in various businesses. The IoT is truly a revolutionary concept and when we consider the different ways in which mobile programs are leveraging IoT. In this informative article, we will consider how mobile apps are benefiting from the technological advancement in this area, but first, let&#8217;s understand how it functions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">IoT can facilitate interaction and communication at all levels. Ease of use along with the growing demand for such applications is two main factors responsible for the increase in IoT application development services. As per the stats, this tech gained importance in 2018. In 2020, the installed base of the Internet of Things devices is forecast to grow to nearly 31 billion worldwide. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Why Should You Affect IoT Solutions in Your Mobile Apps?</b> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Do you think IoT or Internet of Things is a word for the business? The term is quite old, but it is in the limelight again in the past couple of years. The reason is IoT can facilitate interaction and communication. Ease of use and growing program demand are two major factors responsible for the rise of IoT application development services. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The ideal instrument which can be employed to exploit the benefits of IoT solutions is the mobile phone. There are currently over 2.6 billion smartphone consumers in the world and also the industry analysis proves that smartphone users will increase considerably in the years to come. This makes them even more accessible. Also, they offer a more flexible platform for transmitting information when compared with web apps. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">IoT development in mobile programs facilitates the remote control of additional smart gadgets using a single mobile device. Bear in mind that the devices have been assigned their unique IP addresses and they&#8217;re all attached to the internet. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Why is IoT different from other technologies?</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Software and hardware capabilities:</b> The IoT network and relevant applications must have the ability to handle complex business operations and be compatible with mobile application solutions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Selection of programming framework: </b>You need to make sure it prior to if the app would be compatible with the existing IoT network or while selecting the programming frame. </span></p>

Or, you&#8217;ve got a present app on its last legs that need a significant upgrade. In case you do not have mobile developers in your beck and call and a team of UI/UX designers, what should you do? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Making a successful mobile application is a procedure involving quite an extensive pre-planning. <a href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><b>Mobile </b><b>A</b><b>pplication </b><b>Developmen</b></span><b><span style="color: #ff0000;">t</span></b></a> may be as easy as throwing a couple of things together, opening the IDE up, performing a fast form of testing, and submitting it to a Program Store, all done in the work of half day. Or you may make it an extremely involved process between rigorous design, QA testing on a great deal of usability testing devices, a beta lifecycle, then installation a few different ways will give contour. Here is a look at the app development lifecycle and the objectives and challenges along the way. </span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Various Phases of Mobile Application Development</span></strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Research</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">All programs begin with an idea, even if yours is to get a mobile app presence. Refine that notion to a solid foundation for a program. Ensure that your analysis consists of motivations demographics, behavior patterns, and objectives of your client persona. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">In this period, you lay down the groundwork for what is to follow next. Before continuing on to the next phase do your piece of brainstorming and research. And yet another significant part of this phase is currently analyzing the contest. An analysis of your competitor&#8217;s app will help you figure out what attributes are absent in their program that you may include it in your app, to allow it to stand out. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Wireframe</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Aim to create a very clear understanding of how ideas and your proposed features will fuse together into a program. You should produce a storyboard or a roadmap, the way the users will navigate through the app and </span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">demonstrate the relationship between each screen. Look for opportunities to incorporate your brand, focus on the consumer experience and keep in mind the differences in the way that people use a cell app versus a site. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5386" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development.jpg" alt="Mobile Application Development - Build your Dream App Using Various Phases" width="800" height="550" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development-300x206.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development-768x528.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development-100x70.jpg 100w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development-218x150.jpg 218w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development-696x479.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mobile-Application-Development-611x420.jpg 611w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />Design</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Everything you get is blueprints and direction that is visual, notifying your engineers of the envisioned final product and about how interaction feel, should move and flow. Based upon app budget and your project scope, this layout period can be completed or may take a group many hours. And remember to create multiple variations of a screen by playing around with the design of navigation buttons and other components. The more your merchandise fluctuates, the higher the possibility of your UX being original. Application designing will prove to be a procedure, and your results should be clear visual directions providing an abstraction of the end item. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Development</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">The app goes through a set of phases, as the development progresses. At the first stage, the center functionality although the current isn&#8217;t analyzed. Watch the app is buggy, and also non-core functionality does not exist at this point. At the second phase, a lot of the functionality is incorporated. The program has gone through testing and bug fixing, though some problems could still be current. Within this stage, the app is released to a group of outside users to get testing. After the bugs at the second stage are fixed, the app will proceed to the deployment stage where it is ready for launch. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">If yours is a job where user requirements change use agile methodology. It helps with early installation, a development that is progressive, adaptive planning, and continuous improvements. A large application can be broken down into smaller modules, and agile methodology can be applied to every one of these parts. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Testing</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Application testing is vast, so make sure that your team covers all the aspects of it. The program ought to be tested for usability, compatibility, security tests, anxiety, and performance. In consumer acceptance testing you discover whether your app works for your users or not. To test your app is given by this and ask questions. Once your program passes the user acceptance test, you know your answer &#8220;works&#8221; And further make your program available through the registration of previously identified groups or an open solicitation for participants, possibly for a beta trial. The feedback you get from beta customers can help you learn if the functions of the app are working in a real-life circumstance. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Deployment</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Your program is about to submit. Select a day and key up a formal launch. For different program shops, or launch an application, the policies are distinct. And keep in mind, this is not the end. App development does not end at launching. Opinions will pour in Since your application puts at users&#8217; hands, and you will need to incorporate that feedback into future versions of the app. Every program will need updates and capabilities. </span></p>

With the debut of new tendencies in email marketing such as gamification, hyper-personalization, typography, machine learning, etc. marketers produce new strategies for their email campaigns. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you own a business, then you need to think about running email marketing </span>campaigns<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> and incorporate the recent tendencies. However, before that, here are the most crucial steps which have to be followed to make the most of your email marketing strategy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Email marketing is an effective digital strategy, particularly for companies with limited marketing resources, because it delivers the highest return on investment (ROI). For each dollar that you invest, you can generate $44 &#8212; that&#8217;s 4400 percent in ROI! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Let us take a peek at how you can market your emails. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Build your Email List</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">No matter how great or high-quality your </span>emails<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">, if nobody opens them it is a waste of time and energy. Although it may be tempting to get or mine email addresses to rapidly get an initial subscriber database, do not do it! Not only is it unethical, but folks don&#8217;t enjoy receiving emails that they didn&#8217;t opt into, and you can drive potential customers away from your brand. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">It&#8217;s time to build your email list so that you may begin sending campaigns which those goals. There are a couple of different methods by which you can build your email list. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Import a List of Known Contacts</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you&#8217;re planning on using email to stay in contact with existing customers, then your email list could be built largely by importing your existing client&#8217;s details into your preferred email marketing tool. For Campaign Monitor clients, you may either manually upload </span>an present<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> list or you can join your own Campaign Monitor account to the tool wherever your client data resides and automatically sync your client information into your Campaign Monitor account. Before you export any contacts though, make certain you have sufficient permission to email these readers. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Create Your List from Scratch</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Fortunately for you, there is a 2-part formulation for building your email list that&#8217;s followed by many of the very prosperous email marketers </span>around<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">. The formula is: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">How many subscribe chances you present to some visitor, it&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;ll act with no valuable incentive. And however great your incentive is, you still will need to make it simple for people to subscribe if you would like to make them join your listing. </span></p>

</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="1" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> Email marketing scales, the effort to send a single or 100.000 messages is nearly the same. </span></li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">A <b>welcome email</b> returns long-term involvement &#8212; just be sure that you send them straight away. Your welcome email may offer content recommendations, as well as reductions can make new subscribers feel special and glad to have signed up. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you&#8217;ve got a sale or even a limited-time-only discount voucher, you can let your subscribers know through a <b>promotional </b><b>email address</b>.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">A <b>re-order email</b> is a good way to remind readers about your brand, and also to demonstrate care for their workplace or their wellbeing. If they don&#8217;t re-engage, another opportunity is made to deliver a &#8220;we miss you&#8221; email. You can provide a special discount to entice them to come-back. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Make Your Emails Mobile-Friendly</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Did you know that 41% of email open rates happen on mobile devices? All it takes is a slow load or cluttered screen to send mobile readers packaging without engaging with your content. To create your emails properly display on any screen size without having to spend too much time (and funding), utilize a reactive email template. Many email automation tools are going to have a built-in layout service. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Alternatively, you should: </span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Avoid designing multiple columns, because your content will look condensed on cellular; utilize one column whenever possible. </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Set the width attribute to 600 pixels. </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Opt for larger font sizes; 13 or 14pt are perfect font sizes for email advertising but don&#8217;t be afraid to go higher. </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Make your call-to-action bold and easy to locate. </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Keep your subject line short and get the hook in the first two phrases, because cellular devices only show 25-30 characters. </span></li>
<li data-leveltext="" data-font="Symbol" data-listid="2" aria-setsize="-1" data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Add ALT tags so your subscribers can ascertain the meaning of the image even if the images are not rendering due to the browser or device issues. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Engage through Social Networking</b></span></h2>

Stay conscious of trending issues that are of interest to your customers and prospects. Use social media to encourage folks to see one of those stations where they may register to your email list. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Email advertising lets you connect directly with clients and prospects, build brand awareness, and improve sales without breaking your budget. With email marketing tools and services, any company can produce and send successful email campaigns.  </span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, picture dimensions, and scripting abilities. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The concept of Responsive Web </b><b>Design</b> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Responsive web design becomes quite clear if you take a moment to analyze and understand the intricacies of </span>the contemporary<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> net and mobile technology, and implementing responsive design is simpler than you may think. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The number of those devices has increased exponentially, which in turn has improved the variety of browsers specifications and display resolutions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">There is a wide variety of information on responsive web design available all over the Internet, and a lot of </span>information<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> is abstract, philosophical, and anecdotal. If you&#8217;re looking for a tidy, concrete understanding of the base of responsive web design, it comes down to below methods that all work in conjunction: </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5371" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design.jpg" alt="Responsive web design" width="1600" height="958" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design.jpg 1600w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-300x180.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-768x460.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-696x417.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-1068x639.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-701x420.jpg 701w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />Fluid Images</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">There are a couple issues that crop up with flexible media but the biggest issue is around ratio that&#8217;s a knock-on effect from defining height and width on the component itself. Since the viewport grows larger the contained image/video/iframe grows wider too, which means that it needs to grow taller also. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">What&#8217;s the best method to design a website that will be looked at on countless different display sizes, some of which might not even exist yet? The ideal approach is not one comprising catering to specific devices; it&#8217;s one that more generally makes your layout scalable, adaptive, and adaptable to screens of all sizes, even sizes which are yet to become popular. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>There are few points to make it responsive &#8211;</b> </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If the maximum width of the image is set to 100 percent of the screen width or the browser then the overall screening width diminishes, the image will scale down proportionally. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Another method that aims not just to resize images, but also to decrease the resolution of images on smaller devices in order to not waste space, loading time, and expensive mobile bandwidth on more small mobile screens. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Media Queries</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Media Queries are possibly the most important tool a web designer has to create their sites </span>responsively<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5372" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries.jpg" alt="Concept and Principles of Responsive Web Design" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries.jpg 1200w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-768x432.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />This set of rules enables developers to create fluid layouts that accommodate without distortion or loss of quality to the viewer&#8217;s device. It is great to point out that this set of guidelines (or principles) ought to be stored in a separate CSS stylesheet from the one where there are those for the general style (which is usually named style.css). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Media questions help take into consideration multiple display possibilities and, as a result, the organized style rules can be modified quickly and easily. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>P</b><b>rinciples of </b><b>R</b><b>esponsive </b><b>W</b><b>eb </b><b>D</b><b>esign</b> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Responsive website design is a great solution to our multi-screen problem, but getting into it in the printing standpoint is difficult. No page size, no millimeters or inches, regardless of actual limitations to resist against. Designing in pixels for Desktop and Mobile just is also the past, as a growing number of gadgets may open up a website. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Therefore, let&#8217;s clarify some basic principles of responsive web design here in order to adopt the fluid web, instead of fighting it. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Proper use of Breakpoints</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Breakpoints allow the layout to change at predefined factors, i.e. having 3 columns on a desktop, but just 1 column onto a mobile device. Most CSS properties could be changed from 1 breakpoint into another. Usually where you put one is determined by the content. If a sentence breaks, then you might have to add a breakpoint. But use them with caution &#8212; it may get cluttered quickly when it&#8217;s difficult to understand what&#8217;s affecting what. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design.png" alt="Concept and Principles of Responsive Web Design" width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-300x202.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-768x517.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-696x468.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-624x420.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />Fluid Grids</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">When a design is coded in relative proportions of the components on the webpage, this layout is known as a &#8220;fluid grid&#8221;. Traditionally, a CSS layout uses fixed width grids to place each element online page. This fixed-width approach is no longer viable today since there are many displays, from phone screens to HDTV displays. Now, each component is given a relative size or percent instead of particular heights and widths. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Mobile or Desktop First</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Technically there isn&#8217;t a great deal of difference if a job is started from a smaller display to a bigger or vice versa. Yet it provides additional limitations and makes it possible to make decisions if you start with mobile. Frequently people start from both ends at once, so really, go and see what works best for you. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Accessibility </span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Every single consumer should be able to get every single piece of information on your page in the simplest manner possible. The text ought to be readable on all display sizes. The colors should be appealing, yet not harsh on the eyes. Do not let the content be overpowered by the background. The plan should have visual harmony and balance with all the color scheme as well as contrast. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Nested objects</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Remember the comparative position? With a lot of elements based on each other would be difficult to control. So, wrapping elements in a container retain it way more clear, tidy and clean. This is where static units like pixels can help. They are useful for articles that you don&#8217;t wish to scale, like logos and buttons. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Bitmap images vs Vectors</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5374" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bitmap-images-vs-Vectors.jpg" alt="Concept and Principles of Responsive Web Design" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bitmap-images-vs-Vectors.jpg 600w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bitmap-images-vs-Vectors-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Is it true that your icon </span>possess<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> a lot of details and some fancy effects applied? If yes, use a bitmap. If not, consider employing a vector picture. Each has some advantages and some drawbacks. However, remember the dimensions &#8212; no graphics should go online without optimization. Vectors on the other hand often are tiny, but some older browsers won&#8217;t support it. Furthermore, if it&#8217;s lots of curves, it may be heavier than a bitmap, so select wisely.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5361" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development-.jpg" alt="The Future Revolution of Software Development" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development-.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--300x188.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--768x480.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--696x435.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--672x420.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />The current decade and also the world of how we develop and deploy software is now changing incredibly fast. In 2010 many groups had already adopted practices such as Agile, Test Driven Development (TDD), as well as Continuous Integration (CI), but the vast majority of development teams were still doing things the conservative way, with big Product Requirement Documents, year or multi-year-long development cycles with a multi-month code-freeze and QA interval at the end. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">A shockingly large number of software jobs did not even have any kind of comprehensive regular regression testing. Five years later, just about everyone uses some kind of Agile with a decent test-suite, and those published on a yearly or quarterly cadence are the laggards, firmly in the minority; most software jobs release or deploy new versions multiple times a month and some even a few times per day. By moving out of the old, waterfall style to Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD) and adopting DevOps, new attributes are introduced quicker, delivering competitive advantage and reacting more quickly to consumer needs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The wider digital market has obviously been undergoing huge changes at the exact same moment. The computer software is ever-more vital to the world we live in. </span>Waymo&#8217;s<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> self-driving cars lately passed eight million miles travelled. Microsoft&#8217;s translation engine, even though not fluent in six million forms of communication, can match human levels of accuracy in Chinese-to-English tasks.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #333399;">In this new world, developers no longer need to design a unique algorithm for each problem. Most work focuses, instead, on generating datasets that reflect the desired behaviour and managing the training process. Pete Warden from Google’s TensorFlow team pointed this out as far back as 2014: “I used to be a coder,” he wrote. “Now I teach computers to write their own programs.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The Coming </b><b>Revolution </b><b>in Software Development</b></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Programming and data science will converge</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Most applications will not include &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; learning systems for the foreseeable future. It will rely on information models to provide core cognition capacities and explicit logic to interface with customers and interpret results.  </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>AI professionals will be rock stars</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Doing AI is hard. Rank-and-file AI programmers &#8211; not just brilliant academics and researchers &#8211; will probably be one of the most valuable resources for software companies later on.  </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The AI toolchain needs to be constructed</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">&#8220;Machine learning is at the primordial soup phase. You really had to be a world&#8217;s expert to find these things to function.&#8221; Studies also show that many AI versions are tough to explain, trivial to fool and susceptible to bias. Tools to tackle these problems, among others, will be essential to </span>unlocking<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> the potential of AI programmers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The core breakthrough supporting every one of those advances is deep learning, an artificial intelligence technique motivated by the structure of the human brain. What started as a relatively narrow data analysis tool now functions as something close to a general computing platform. It outperforms traditional software across a broad assortment of jobs and may finally deliver the intelligent systems which have long eluded computer scientists &#8211; feats which the press sometimes blow out of proportion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">As software controls more and more of the planet around us, programs no longer function in isolation, but interact with other applications and operate on multiple devices in an increasingly complex ecosystem. Modern practices didn&#8217;t make life easier for long; rather they allow us to perform more and so complexity increased.</span></p>
