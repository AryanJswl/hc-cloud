<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>

So in today&#8217;s world everything is digitally available and Sales Funnel is a core concept of&nbsp;<strong>Digital Marketing</strong>.

<p>A sales funnel is a marketing concept that maps out the journey a customer goes through when making any kind of purchase. The model uses a funnel as an analogy because a large number of potential customers may begin at the top-end of the&nbsp;sales process, but only a fraction of these people actually end up making a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can Reach Right Audience for your Business?</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sales Funnel is divided into multiple Steps</h2>



<p>Sales funnel is divided into multiple steps, which differ depending on the particular sales model. One of the most common ways of dividing a sales funnel possesses seven phases including:</p>



<p><strong>Awareness Phase</strong> Inn which prospects become aware of the existence of a solution.</p>



<p><strong>Interest Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects demonstrate interest in a product by conducting product research.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects or prospect companies examine competitors’ solutions as they inch toward a final buying decision.</p>



<p><strong>Decision Phase</strong>&nbsp;– In which a final decision is reached and negotiation begins.</p>



<p><strong>Purchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which goods or services are purchased.</p>



<p><strong>Reevaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in B2B sales it’s common for offerings to involve contracts that need to be renewed. As a customer becomes familiar with an offering, and especially as a contract draws to a close, a customer will enter a reevaluation phase during which they’ll decide whether or not to renew their contract.</p>



<p><strong>Repurchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which a customer repurchases a product or service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing each Stage of sales process</h2>



<p>Optimizing your website, facebook ads, sales funnel plays an important role to increase traffic, leads and Both marketing teams and inside sales managers commonly adopt strategies, tools, and tactics aimed at optimizing each stage of their sales process.

<p>In today’s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Reading the ebullient reports, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives. And admittedly, it’s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so “there” you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we’re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.</span></a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All technologies come with risks</strong></h2>



<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it’s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It’s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don’t just enrich those who create them.</p>



<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robotics</span></a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/what-is-internet-of-things/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;– three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we rethink risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab</strong>, we’re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it’s the individuals, communities and organizations – the constituents – who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.</p>

Well, the answer is It helps in simplifying raw data into a very easily understandable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tableau </strong>is a powerful and rapidly growing data visualization tool used in the BI, BA and Data Analytics Industry. It make Data analysis very fast and the visualizations created are in the form of dashboards and worksheets. It even allows a non-tech person to create dashboards.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Firstly you need to understand about&nbsp;<strong>virtualization</strong></h2>



<p><strong>data virtualization&nbsp;</strong>is a pictorial representation of a given set of data. A text-based data is represented in a form of charts, tables, infographics, etc. So that new insight and hidden pattern of data can be detected and understands in a more easy way. Tableau plays a key role in Business Intelligence. I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is Tableau?</strong> and why Tableau a Powerful Tool</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are three features in tableau which help in analysing data efficiently.</h2>



<ol><li>Data Blending</li><li>Real-time analysis</li><li>collaboration of data</li></ol>



<p>Tableau was founded by Pat Hanrahan, Christian Chabot, and Chris Stolte in 2003. Tableau has a <strong>mapping functionalities </strong>which helps to plot coordinates and connect to spatial files. Tableau become popular because of its easy drag-and-drop functionality, it is faster than other BI tools, high scalability as it adapts to the individual as well as enterprise needs easily, it has mobile compatibility, connectivity to a huge number of data sources without needing to buy connector license,<strong><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/big-data-a-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="color:#3425db" class="has-inline-color">big data</span></a></strong>&nbsp;analytics capabilities etc.</p>

<p><strong>Combining python and d3.js to create dynamic visualization applications</strong><em>. D3.js</em>, a powerful library that enables you to build customized&nbsp;visualisations for any kind of storytelling you could imagine for the web.&nbsp;Problem solving through data analysis and programming, on the other hand, is still very much rooted in the linear perspective, since they involve a step by step breakdown of data to understand and solve a problem. However, data analysis when done correctly allows a user to account for minute details and idiosyncrasies that are usually missed when looking at the whole picture. Combing a data driven approach along with a more visual oriented approach provides a holistic approach to problem solving and analysis that combines linear and non-linear perspectives.</p>



<p>What I will demonstrate is how a user can effectively create a data processing back end in python while maintaining a visual front end in&nbsp;<strong>d3.js</strong>&nbsp;to create an effective application. We will also add some controllable features so that the front end and the back end can communicate with each other effectively on the basis of inputs from the final user. The python module we will use is ‘Flask’ which will act as the intermediary between the back end and the front end. The d3 visualization I have chosen is the&nbsp;collapsible bar chart&nbsp;example created by Mike Bostock. Creation of the&nbsp;<strong>visualization structure</strong>&nbsp;will involve some use of html, js and some jinja code.&nbsp;Combining python and d3.js to create dynamic visualization applications.</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;Defining the structure of the application</strong></p>



<p>What we will be doing, is create a front end on a html page which will host our visualization and d3.js scripts. We will send the data to this html page from python code contained in a file called&nbsp;<strong>‘application.py’</strong>. The structure of the application on the computer will be as follows.<br><br>First, let’s design the front end which will be a basic html page (“index.html”) which will host our d3 visualization along with a form where a user can submit a<br>country and year selection. The final html is hosted&nbsp;here.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;input name=”Country_field” placeholder=”Enter country name” &gt; &lt;input type=”number” name=”Year_field” placeholder=”Enter Year” &gt; &lt;input type=”submit” value=”Submit Country and Year” &gt; &lt;/form&gt;</pre>



<p>Now, we will create two divisions, one to host the production data graph on the left and one to host the loss data on the right. The divisions should also display the country and the year selected. We will have to specify ids for the graphs and will have to write out some code in jinja to get the country name and the year.&nbsp;Combining python and d3.js to create dynamic visualization applications</p>



<p>We will have to repeat the same code to create another division for the loss data.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Third step is creating backend in Python</strong></p>



<p>The steps in creating the python file are a bit more time consuming. The final application file is available&nbsp;here. We will need to perform the following steps,</p>



<p>1. Import neccessary packages, define the application in flask and create a datastore.</p>



<p>2. Create the code to generate data to send to the front end for the home page.</p>



<p>3. Convert data into json format for d3 and send the same to the front end</p>

<p>Today’s we are going to discuss&nbsp;<strong>Most Dangerous Technologies in 2020</strong>. Technology is a boon or bane it is difficult to answer. As we enter new frontiers with the latest technology trends and enjoy the many positive impacts and benefits it can have on the way we work, play and live, we must always be mindful and prepare for possible negative impacts and potential misuse of the technology. Following are the Most Dangerous Technology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drone Swarms</strong></h2>



<p>The British, Chinese, and United States armed forces are testing how interconnected, cooperative <strong>drones</strong> could be used in military operations. While this technology is still in the experimentation stage, the reality of a swarm that is smart enough to coordinate its own behaviour is moving closer to reality. To learn more about drones you can visit<strong><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/drone-technology-uses-and-applications/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"> Drones Application</span></a></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Spying Smart Home Devices</strong></h2>



<p>When you added the Echo to your room as a radio and alarm clock (or any other smart device connected to the Internet), you also allowed a spy to enter a home.&nbsp;All the information smart devices collect about your habits such as your viewing history on&nbsp;<strong>Netflix</strong>; where you live and what route you take home so Google can tell you how to avoid traffic, and all the info stored in the cloud. Of course, this information makes your life more convenient, but there is also the potential for abuse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI Cloning&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>With the support of artificial intelligence (AI), all that’s needed to create a clone of someone’s voices are just a snippet of audio. AI to create an artificial YOU and the results are so convincing our brains have trouble differentiating between what is real and what is cloned. This can be used for creating fake videos.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ransomware</strong></h2>



<p>AI and Bot-enabled Blackmailing and Hacking.When high-powered technology falls into the wrong hands, it can be very effective to achieve criminal, immoral, and malicious activities.Ransomware, where malware is used to prevent access to a computer system until a ransom is paid, is on the rise according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p>
