This framework is an equipped with required policies to manage all the digital identity. This also has all the technologies those needed to handle and support identities. IAM is like a wall between critical information and employees\/ users within the organization. With this, you can control privileges and circumstance of those privileges granted to the user. The IAM system is developed so that one user has only one identity.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\"><strong>What Does Identity and Access Management Do?<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once these identities are settled IAM have a task to maintain, modify and monitor that identity. This access process will run till the \u201caccess lifecycle\u201d of the user. So we can say that the IAM service has a goal i.e. providing access to the right enterprise to the right use of right information. This works from user\u2019s system onboarding to permission authorization to offboarding of that user. These are words from Yassir Abousselham. He is senior VP and Chief Security Officer for Okta. Okta is an enterprise identity and access management providing company.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With the IAM administrator can make alterations in user\u2019s role, work, limitation, keeping track or user activity and more. It can also generate a report based on those tacking. These controls are available across all over the enterprise.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\"><strong>What was the Problem here?<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many companies are moving toward the clouds and many are already into <span style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #a30000;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #ffffff; background-color: #a30000;\" href=\"https:\/\/hawkscode.com\/services\/cloud-computing\/\" target=\"_blank\">cloud computing<\/a><\/strong><\/span>. The problem started when these companies started facing identity problem in their cloud. These were some serious problems those were not experienced before by them. It is as hard as managing data in your own data centre. But as clouds came in IT have to do more than that and for unexperienced clouds, they don\u2019t know of.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These changes in the system and security is a very long, busy and devastating practice that shatter the security. Business got some problems here. Due this heavy process, they get more focused on managing data resolving identity problem. Their focus just gets moved from securing these clouds first and that makes it vulnerable. This creates a blind spot and increases security risk.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The thing here is that cybersecurity is not a joke and need to apply to any and all system of organization. But there is a big help by some cybersecurity companies and cloud computing companies. They know and have good practices with experience over these kinds of things. Now businesses who are not into IT do not have to worry or hire specialists. They can contact one of these company to take care of these things.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\"><strong>How does IAM Help in Cloud Computing?<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0IAM provides password security, provision software, security-policy enforcement. This is work of Identity Access. Then on other hand identity management works software like Microsoft SharePoint, or cloud-based Office 360. Other than these some of its solutions are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h5><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">API Security<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">Identity as a Service (IDaaS)<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">Customer IAM (CIAM)<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">Identity Analysis (IA)<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">Identity Management and Governance (IMG)<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<h5><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffff00;\">Risk-Based Authentication (RBA)<\/span><\/strong><\/h5>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<h3><span style=\"background-color: #00ccff;\"><strong>Still, Why One Need IAM?<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<hr \/>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\u00a0Truly speaking, it is like an important and major member of the security family. Let\u2019s think about it as an example. There is much organization who have lots of information and user. Most of the time it happens that some user can access some those information that they should have access to. So, here IAM work as a filter layer. It will eliminate these people who shouldn\u2019t have access to that information. It is like a security layer to your security system. This layer will reduce the complexity of your user network also reducing the risk by limiting their access.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>IAM is a framework provided to business processes that will help with management of electric and digital identity.
