Coronavirus has put a rocket below plans for extra automation, roboticisation and use of AI. Ought to we worry for our jobs \u2013 or will we simply get higher ones?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a fundamental impact on the global labour market in the next few years. Therefore, the authors discuss legal, economic and business issues, such as changes in the future labour market and in company structures, impact on working time, remuneration and on the working environment, new forms of employment and the impact on labour relations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At many places you can see clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst<strong> UV Bot, with its 1000 watts\u2019 <\/strong>worth of UVC light capable of \u201ctearing apart strands of virus DNA\u201d, comes here every night, as well as to a few other<strong> malls and hospitals in Singapore<\/strong>. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the\u00a0covid-19\u00a0pandemic: cleaning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals,\u00a0Moxi\u00a0delivers medications, lab samples and supplies.\u00a0P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets.\u00a0James the telepresence bot\u00a0helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots\u00a0scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking\u00a0the coronavirus\u2019s\u00a0genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend towards automation and\u00a0roboticisation isn\u2019t new\u00a0\u2013 but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. \u201cWhat this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance\u201d, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. \u201cIn these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone \u2013 with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So is there any solution to this problem is Robot is going to capture the market which will lead to unemployment. But yes in today&#8217;s time it is difficult to get a robot for petty works because it&#8217;s costing is too high but yes in future we are going to totally rely on robots for petty work also.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you like this blog, to learn more visit <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hawkscode.com\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">HawksCode<\/span><\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.easyshiksha.com\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">Easyshiksha<\/span><\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Drone Technology Uses and Applications | Working Of Drone | Details @hawkscode.com\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/BrbvvPnvHKc?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about Will robots and AI take our jobs in covid-19\u2019s socially distanced era?
