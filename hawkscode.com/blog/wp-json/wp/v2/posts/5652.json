And admittedly, it\u2019s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so \u201cthere\u201d you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we\u2019re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.<\/span><\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>All technologies come with risks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it\u2019s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It\u2019s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don\u2019t just enrich those who create them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/news.easyshiksha.com\/amazing-humanoid-robots\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">robotics<\/span><\/a><\/strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/news.easyshiksha.com\/tag\/artificial-intelligence\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">artificial intelligence (AI)<\/span><\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/news.easyshiksha.com\/what-is-internet-of-things\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)<\/span><\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How do we rethink risk?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab<\/strong>, we\u2019re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it\u2019s the individuals, communities and organizations \u2013 the constituents \u2013 who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">I hope you like this blog<strong>,&nbsp;Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;<\/strong>To learn more tech related blogs visit&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http:\/\/www.hawkscode.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">HawksCode<\/span><\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/news.easyshiksha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><span class=\"has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\">Easyshiksha<\/span><\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In today\u2019s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;Reading the ebullient reports, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives.
