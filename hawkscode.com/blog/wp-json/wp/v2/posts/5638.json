In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I\u2019ve heard it all:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>\u201cYou can\u2019t have privacy if you use Android!\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cYou can\u2019t have security if you use Android!\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cYou can\u2019t get upgrades if you use Android!\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cYou can\u2019t have a good user experience if you use Android!\u201d<\/li><li>\u201cYOU CAN\u2019T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!\u201d<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;<\/em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I\u2019m here to tell you they\u2019re all equally misguided.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Now, don\u2019t get me wrong:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a&nbsp;<em>nugget<\/em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we\u2019re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don\u2019t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don\u2019t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself \u2014 as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform \u2014 overlooks one key point. It\u2019s a foundational reality of Android that\u2019s been at the system\u2019s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches<\/strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app\u2019s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner \u2014 that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn\u2019t<\/em>&nbsp;an \u201cAndroid way\u201d \u2014 not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it\u2019s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Same level of choice and control<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world\u2019s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story \u2014 the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Choice and control within Android<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll start with privacy \u2014 an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;<\/em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn\u2019t actually that it\u2019s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It\u2019s simply that Google\u2019s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don\u2019t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it \u2014 at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults \u2014 and most people aren\u2019t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What\u2019s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide<\/strong>; it\u2019s just up to you to embrace it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Security Concerns<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What about security? Well, it\u2019s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources \u2014&nbsp;<em>the horror!<\/em>&nbsp;\u2014 but, y\u2019know, it\u2019s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do<\/em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they\u2019ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It\u2019s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the realm of updates \u2014 both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It\u2019s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pixel, as I\u2019ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It\u2019s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company\u2019s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be \u2014 a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn\u2019t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it\u2019s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;<\/em>to make. There\u2019s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone\u2019s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities \u2014 and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Android and iOS<\/strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates \u2019em. Neither platform\u2019s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are<\/em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color\">I hope you like this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss<\/strong>.
