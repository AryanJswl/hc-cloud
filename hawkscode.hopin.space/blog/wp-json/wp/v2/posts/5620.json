One of the most common ways of dividing a sales funnel possesses seven phases including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Awareness Phase<\/strong> Inn which prospects become aware of the existence of a solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interest Phase<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 in which prospects demonstrate interest in a product by conducting product research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Evaluation Phase<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 in which prospects or prospect companies examine competitors\u2019 solutions as they inch toward a final buying decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Decision Phase<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 In which a final decision is reached and negotiation begins.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Purchase Phase<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 in which goods or services are purchased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reevaluation Phase<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 in B2B sales it\u2019s common for offerings to involve contracts that need to be renewed. As a customer becomes familiar with an offering, and especially as a contract draws to a close, a customer will enter a reevaluation phase during which they\u2019ll decide whether or not to renew their contract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Repurchase Phase<\/strong>&nbsp;\u2013 in which a customer repurchases a product or service.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Optimizing each Stage of sales process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing your website, facebook ads, sales funnel plays an important role to increase traffic, leads and Both marketing teams and inside sales managers commonly adopt strategies, tools, and tactics aimed at optimizing each stage of their sales process.
