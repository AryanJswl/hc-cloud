<p>In todays topic we will discuss&nbsp;<strong>Drone technology uses and applications.</strong> Drones also known by the name Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Miniature Pilotless Aircraft or Flying Mini&nbsp;<strong>Roborts</strong>. Over the past few years drones demand is booming in market and is used for differenet industries. From quicky deliveries at rush hour to the unreachable military basecamp drones are proving extreamly usefull in places where man cannot reach. You can also learn through my new blogs the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/how-do-drones-work/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working of drones</span></strong>&nbsp;</a>and its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bit.ly/2Uzhsz0" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working without GPS</span></strong></a>.</p>



<p>Initially known for military use, drones are now being used by individual enterpreneurs. According to a study by the year 2020, 16 million drones will be sold in commercial markets of the world below you can see the&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drone technology uses and applications</strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aerial Photography</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are use to capture footage that would otherwise requires expensive choppers. No need of pilot. Easy to reach at anyplace small and compact in size which let it take magnifying pictures by getting close to the place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shipping and Delivery</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use for fast delivery of food, small packages, medicines, beverages, letters for smaller distance. Many companies like Amazon, UPS are in favour of using drones for shot disctance delivery it will save time a lot of man power, unecessary road traffic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disaster Management</strong></h2>



<p>Drones provide a quick report after a natural or man-made disaster geather information of injured people or the total distruction. Rescue people and provide them food, water etc.You can take a example of corona virus spread in china now they provide food and water to victams through drones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Geographic Mapping</strong></h2>



<p>Drones can acquire very high-resolution data and download imagery in difficult to reach locations like coastlines, mountain tops, and islands. They are also used to create 3D maps and contribute to crowd sourced mapping applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Agriculture</strong></h2>



<p>Drones use infrared sensors to detact the crop health, enable farmers to improve crop. This is a cheap and effective method for farmers to input fertilizers and pesticides.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weather Forecast</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use to forecast weather it can monitore unpredictable weather, Since they are cheap and unmanned, drones can be sent into hurricanes and tornados, so that scientists and weather forecasters acquire new insights into their behavior.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Military</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are used by military for reaching terrorist campgrounds and use in war as well.</p>

But if we had made this list without android studio then it would be a cheat. Android Studio is official IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Android that keeps you update. It has all the material designs that Google have updated itself with. We are listing here some more editors and tools that will help you with App development.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Android apps are officially developed on Java, but now it also supports C++. And now Google has introduced its own language ‘Kotlin’. IDE just help you in compiling all the system and program file in an APK. This arranged file and program in an executable file for mobile. Now, this tool has additional tools too that comes in single download now. Android Studio is always the first choice for every developer.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00;"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Mobile Application Development with AVD Manager</span></strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AVD is a virtual simulation of android device. AVD stands for “Android Virtual Devices” It let you test the application into your system without installing it again and again in the physical device. This will help you know how well your design will look into most of the devices. Now you just need to test it on some popular devices and you are all set. This emulation software allows you to create different emulators for devices with different size and different version of OS. The performance will increase with the time, even more with the ‘virt mode’. This mode will run Intel version of the android to your device. Also, this will remove the instruction level emulation.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;">Android Device Monitor</span></strong></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is just like the task manager. It will keep you updated with the running status of the application. What kind of thread is using the network, how many processes, LogCat and other things? This monitoring tool is a built-in function that comes with Android studio. It is great for testing and performance monitoring.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #00ff00;"><strong>Android Debug Bridge</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is a little one-line command that is useful in making communication with your device whether virtual or physical. ADB is a pre-installed feature of the android studio. It is very easy to use and needed frequently. As if you any tutorial you will find it each time. So as you start <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com.au/technologies/Mobile-Application/Android-App-Development/" target="_blank">android application development</a></strong></span> you need to open it. To open it you need to go to the installation folder and then open the platform-tools folder or any folder where you will find adb.exe and then open a command line there. To open command line press Shift + RMB then click open command line here.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Android Game Development with Unity 3D</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A game engine, that is popular with game developers. Unity keeps you out of a headache and problem of lengthy codes and time. It is possible to develop a game with Android Studio but its features surpass Studio. It is a cross-platform game development and IDE. One thing to consider is that does not comes in-built. You have to separately download it to your system. You can make Virtual Reality apps for VR devices like Cardboard, Gear VR and Daydream.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #00ff00; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Unreal Engine</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another game engine that is superior to the Unity 3D. It provides easy support for the Android. If you are into full cross-platform application/ game development you can use this engine. But when it comes to better built-in support Unity 3D surpasses it. But it is up to you that you either choose Unity or Unreal. You should try at least both first before making any decision.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any experience into the development of the application, you know how hard it is to find a perfect developer. If you are thinking of saving some hundred or thousands of dollar by neglecting quality then you are making a big mistake. It is always hard when it comes to finding out a solution with <strong><a style="color: red;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/" target="_blank">mobile applications</a></strong>. So you need a right guide to choose a better developer. You should invest good, not much not less. But you should know better the app be greater the revenue will become.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer That Take Interest:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An Application Developer or development company should not just be making an app for you. But they should share their experience of making app into same domain. They should tell you what are users seeking into this kind of apps. What are the solutions they can provide you from their experience? A developer must take interest in your business or idea of applications.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What User Looks Into App:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The application developer must have a good experience in <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></strong></span> skills. You must check their portfolio. A user downloads an app only if they get impressed by the UI in the screenshot. Apps are all the show of attracting eyes of a user. If your app can’t make a good impression it will fail. Also if the app is failed in user experience, then the product will fail again. You need to impress the audience with the first attempt.</p>
<h3><strong>What Other says About Them:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one has that long life that will give them the experience of everything. You should remember that they have experience into this. That means they have some clients too. Try to get reviews from those who have worked with them before. Reviews will help you in sorting out the right one for you without any hassle.</p>
<h3><strong>Go Through Full App Lifecycle:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An app developer should keep working on the application throughout its lifecycle. Choose someone who can be there with an app whole time. Company or developer should not abandon the app just after it is completed or hosted. Applications need to evolve with time to time. This evolution is based on the reviews given by the user.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality will Pay You in Long Term:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you are into <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/android-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>application development</strong></a></span> you should make sure that you are with good one. You are here to make a good product so don’t go with some cheap one. Don’t make saving money is your only goal here. Yes, no one comes with a great budget but still, you need to make a decent investment in the app. Mobile Apps are long-term running projects and cheap investment will break it before your estimated life cycle.</p>
<h3><strong>Be with a Team:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project is done by a team where everyone has their own role to play. Everyone is expert in their own field. So never go with a sole developer. He may make a better performing application but not a good UI and UX. Why? Because it is not his cup of tea. Have a team while doing development or have a good company that will provide you with every asset regarding the application development.</p>

But now it is used for the development of many different applications and solutions like system administration, database control, administration panel. Back then most of the people were used to be designers. It is right now one of the major development languages. But now people are moving toward making every new website as a SaaS. Here we will make discussion on how to make better web and application development with PHP.</p>
<h4>Use Core PHP Function and Classes:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a better and fast development of the website or application, one can take advantage of predefined functions. These functions are defined to make sure perform some task. All you need to do you is that just call them when you need them. You don’t need to waste your time on the development of your own function. Check the manual before making any new function.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">File for configuration:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can generate a whole single file for the configuration. This will work as a master file. If you need any configuration need to be done then you only need to do that into one file. So that you will need to do that same thing into several different files. This will help in maintaining the code and will make it more modular.</p>
<h4>Error Reporting:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one good thing if you accept your mistakes. Remember you should always keep the error reporting when you are doing the development. This ‘White Screen of Death’ is one thing that will help you improve and maximize your potential. error_reporting&#8217; and &#8216;display_errors&#8217; these will be your two friends in development.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We used to do comments in our code to make it more understanding for other and of self. But do not overdo this practice. A good code is self-explanatory. You need to be more better at making well managed code. Comment only complicated part of your code. Your code need to have a simplicity for understanding.</p>
<h4>Editor need to be Handy:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An editor needs to be good. Your editor need to be a feature rich. These feature should help you with your development and making it more easy. Making yourself comfortable with a handy editor will make the development process more flexible.</p>
