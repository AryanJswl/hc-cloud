<p>In today’s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Reading the ebullient reports, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives. And admittedly, it’s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so “there” you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we’re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.</span></a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All technologies come with risks</strong></h2>



<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it’s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It’s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don’t just enrich those who create them.</p>



<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robotics</span></a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/what-is-internet-of-things/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;– three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we rethink risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab</strong>, we’re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it’s the individuals, communities and organizations – the constituents – who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-1024x576.png" alt="AI based Video Analytics Making Supply Chains Smarter" class="wp-image-5765" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-300x169.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-768x432.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-696x391.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-1068x600.png 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-747x420.png 747w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>AI based Video Analytics Making Supply Chains Smarter</strong>. The growing use of <a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School"><strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong></a>-powered video analytics over the years has radically altered and improved the operations of many processes, across industries and continents. The findings of the IHS Markit Video Surveillance Intelligence Service shows that there has been a consistent growth in the global professional video surveillance equipment market, with the worldwide market revenue jumping up from $18.2 billion in 2018 to $19.9 billion in 2019.</p>



<p>Moreover, the use of video is becoming vital for businesses to ensure better management of their inventory. There are often instances of damage, theft or pilferage of goods, either when they are in the warehouse or in transit. To overcome these challenges, CCTV cameras backed with video analytics are being employed, which can efficiently and instantly track and detect any kind of suspicious activity and further send alerts to the server over the network. The supply chain managers are then able to take prompt action to ensure uninterrupted supply of the products.</p>



<p>At present, when COVID-19 has brought about ripples of turbulence for almost all businesses, requiring them to practice and adopt enhanced safety measures, video analytics has truly been playing a quintessential role by ensuring that all safety precautions are being duly undertaken to limit the spread of infection. The CCTV cameras equipped with video analytics are able to closely monitor the movement of people, making sure that social distancing norms are strictly followed and face masks are mandatorily used. In case of any violation of any of these norms, the system automatically triggers alerts, which allows for appropriate action to be taken.</p>



<p>Further, while during road transport, when goods are transported in bulk from one place to another, the use of video analytics makes it possible for businesses to analyse the truck utilization patterns on a daily basis and gain a view of loading/unloading activity details, load per cent capacity, etc. This aids the supply chain managers to keep a check on the overall productivity of their fleet, and make changes whenever necessary. Also, there are other KPIs like facial recognition, driver wellness, etc., that can be efficiently monitored to ensure control and optimization of the supply chain.</p>



<p>Needless to say, advances in technology have paved the way for many exciting opportunities for businesses. Besides bringing in visibility and transparency, video analytics has proved extremely helpful in ensuring safety, quality, timeliness, performance and productivity for businesses. By seamlessly integrating with the existing video infrastructure, the technology has been successful in increasing the supply chain efficiency, eventually translating into increased customer satisfaction and improved business profits.&nbsp; Isn’t this disruptive? Yes, it certainly is!</p>

<p>In this blog, I will discuss about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>. Imagine your computer could think like you do or even understand you? That future may not be now, but it’s one step closer, thanks to scientists and engineers and their recent discovery of a materials-based mimic for the neural signals responsible for transmitting information within the human brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus</h2>



<p>We are very closer to this reality where material that will change with temperature or an electrical stimulus. The team was able to clarify the mechanism driving this behavior by taking a new look at&nbsp;<strong>β’-CuxV2O5</strong>. A chameleon-like material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus. In the process, they zeroed in on how copper ions move around inside the material and how this subtle dance in turn sloshes electrons around to transform it.</p>



<p>Their research revealed that the movement of copper ions is the linchpin of an electrical conductivity change which can be leveraged to create electrical spikes in the same way that neurons function in the cerebral nervous system. <strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Material</h2>



<p>“Nature has given us materials with the appropriate types of behavior to mimic the information processing that occurs in a brain, but the ones characterized to date have had various limitations,”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of this work is to show that&nbsp;<strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong>&nbsp;and create electrically active materials with significantly improved neuromorphic properties. As we understand more, our materials will improve significantly, thus providing a new path to the continual technological advancement of our computing abilities.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer build a mimic</h2>



<p>A computer built to mimic the brain’s neural networks produces similar results to that of the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movement of Copper ions</h2>



<p>A very small movement of copper ions within the structure brings about a massive change in conductance in the whole material. Because of this movement of copper ions, the material transforms from insulating to conducting in response to external changes in temperature, applied voltage or applied current. There is a huge gap between the energy consumption of the brain and today’s supercomputers. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing allows us to investigate how close we can get to the energy efficiency of the brain using electronics.”</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence</strong>. IN SILICON VALLEY,&nbsp;the new currency is artificial intelligence.Over the last few years, a&nbsp;technology called deep learning&nbsp;has proven so adept at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, and translating from one language to another, the titans of Silicon Valley are eager to push the state of the art even further—and push it quickly. The two biggest players are, yes, Google and Facebook.</p>



<p>It’s a big move, because while software platforms can certain make AI research easier, more replicable, and more shareable, the whole process is nearly impossible without powerful computers.&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence.</strong> If you want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence concept visit <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">.</span></p>



<p>At Google, this tech not only helps the company&nbsp;recognize the commands you bark into your Android phone&nbsp;and&nbsp;instantly translate foreign street signs when you turn your phone their way.&nbsp;Regularly working with images or audio takes can be taxing for consumer-grade equipment, and some types of artificial intelligence have to break down and learn from 10 million pictures in order to learn from them. The process, called training, requires serious computing power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This is how the modern tech world works.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Internet’s largest services typically run on open source software. “Open source is the currency of developers now,” says Sean Stephens, the CEO of a software company called Perfect. “It’s how they share their thoughts and ideas. In the closed source world, developers don’t have a lot of room to move.” And as these services shift to&nbsp;a new breed of streamlined hardware better suited to running enormous operations, many companies are sharing their hardware designs as well.</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about Will robots and AI take our jobs in covid-19’s socially distanced era? Coronavirus has put a rocket below plans for extra automation, roboticisation and use of AI. Ought to we worry for our jobs – or will we simply get higher ones?</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a fundamental impact on the global labour market in the next few years. Therefore, the authors discuss legal, economic and business issues, such as changes in the future labour market and in company structures, impact on working time, remuneration and on the working environment, new forms of employment and the impact on labour relations.</p>



<p>At many places you can see clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst<strong> UV Bot, with its 1000 watts’ </strong>worth of UVC light capable of “tearing apart strands of virus DNA”, comes here every night, as well as to a few other<strong> malls and hospitals in Singapore</strong>. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the covid-19 pandemic: cleaning.</p>



<p>Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals, Moxi delivers medications, lab samples and supplies. P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets. James the telepresence bot helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking the coronavirus’s genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.</p>



<p>This trend towards automation and roboticisation isn’t new – but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. “What this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance”, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. “In these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.”</p>



<p>And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone – with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?</p>



<p>So is there any solution to this problem is Robot is going to capture the market which will lead to unemployment. But yes in today&#8217;s time it is difficult to get a robot for petty works because it&#8217;s costing is too high but yes in future we are going to totally rely on robots for petty work also.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5361" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development-.jpg" alt="The Future Revolution of Software Development" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development-.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--300x188.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--768x480.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--696x435.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--672x420.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />The current decade and also the world of how we develop and deploy software is now changing incredibly fast. In 2010 many groups had already adopted practices such as Agile, Test Driven Development (TDD), as well as Continuous Integration (CI), but the vast majority of development teams were still doing things the conservative way, with big Product Requirement Documents, year or multi-year-long development cycles with a multi-month code-freeze and QA interval at the end. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">A shockingly large number of software jobs did not even have any kind of comprehensive regular regression testing. Five years later, just about everyone uses some kind of Agile with a decent test-suite, and those published on a yearly or quarterly cadence are the laggards, firmly in the minority; most software jobs release or deploy new versions multiple times a month and some even a few times per day. By moving out of the old, waterfall style to Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD) and adopting DevOps, new attributes are introduced quicker, delivering competitive advantage and reacting more quickly to consumer needs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The wider digital market has obviously been undergoing huge changes at the exact same moment. The computer software is ever-more vital to the world we live in. </span>Waymo&#8217;s<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> self-driving cars lately passed eight million miles travelled. Microsoft&#8217;s translation engine, even though not fluent in six million forms of communication, can match human levels of accuracy in Chinese-to-English tasks.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #333399;">In this new world, developers no longer need to design a unique algorithm for each problem. Most work focuses, instead, on generating datasets that reflect the desired behaviour and managing the training process. Pete Warden from Google’s TensorFlow team pointed this out as far back as 2014: “I used to be a coder,” he wrote. “Now I teach computers to write their own programs.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The Coming </b><b>Revolution </b><b>in Software Development</b></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Programming and data science will converge</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Most applications will not include &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; learning systems for the foreseeable future. It will rely on information models to provide core cognition capacities and explicit logic to interface with customers and interpret results.  </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>AI professionals will be rock stars</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Doing AI is hard. Rank-and-file AI programmers &#8211; not just brilliant academics and researchers &#8211; will probably be one of the most valuable resources for software companies later on.  </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The AI toolchain needs to be constructed</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">&#8220;Machine learning is at the primordial soup phase. You really had to be a world&#8217;s expert to find these things to function.&#8221; Studies also show that many AI versions are tough to explain, trivial to fool and susceptible to bias. Tools to tackle these problems, among others, will be essential to </span>unlocking<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> the potential of AI programmers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The core breakthrough supporting every one of those advances is deep learning, an artificial intelligence technique motivated by the structure of the human brain. What started as a relatively narrow data analysis tool now functions as something close to a general computing platform. It outperforms traditional software across a broad assortment of jobs and may finally deliver the intelligent systems which have long eluded computer scientists &#8211; feats which the press sometimes blow out of proportion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">As software controls more and more of the planet around us, programs no longer function in isolation, but interact with other applications and operate on multiple devices in an increasingly complex ecosystem. Modern practices didn&#8217;t make life easier for long; rather they allow us to perform more and so complexity increased.</span></p>

For this purpose, Facebook bought Bloomsbury, a London based AI startup which is specialized in developing and extending machine learning and natural language processing methods. According to Tech Crunch (Tech News Website), Facebook has spent 23 to 30 million dollars to buy Bloomsbury.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How can an AI solve this problem?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5143" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />A very high percentage of people get news from Facebook and (Google-owned) YouTube and both of these major platforms are having troubles with handling the fake news. AI systems can evaluate how well a post’s text or a headline compares with the actual content of an article someone is sharing online. Another side AI systems can compare fake material to identified specific accounts, profiles or source websites. This can help a large number of people to avoid fake content and getting the real fact.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Facebook need an AI?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5144 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Facebook has a division named FAIR (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research) which is working on AI for better user experience. The main goal to have an AI is to improve natural language processing and preventing inappropriate content on  Facebook, Instagram, and its many other properties. Many times facebook acknowledged that with more than 2 billion active users it’s not an easy task to prevent fake news or material that violates Facebook rules. That’s why Facebook decided to acquire Bloomsbury.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What can Bloomsbury do for Facebook?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5141" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Bloomsbury is a British startup company that building an AI that reads text documents and answers questions about the content. In a simple way, this British company can help Facebook to further understand natural language processing and its applications. Earlier Bloomsbury co-founder Sebastian Reidel also helped to create a fake news investigator AI Factmata which can tackle misleading content on the web. So we can say that Bloomsbury is a Triumph card for Facebook to combat against content problems.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other legend tech company’s Contribution in this Campaign</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5142" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />The problems Facebook and Youtube are facing with fake news have alerted other tech companies and Microsoft is also trying to build trusted algorithms and stop false news. Microsoft wants that AI systems are needed to built in to augment human capabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Otherwise, human intelligence is the real key to resolve this issue. It’s important that when somebody sees a violent or inappropriate content then that person should investigate the information, not sharing that immediately. Facebook and other companies are doing their best but users should be sensible and wise about this problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/why-facebook-organic-reach-is-falling-low-and-low/" target="_blank">Facebook</a></span></strong> and YouTube like tech giants are facing fake news problem that is been increasing day by day. Microsoft is seeking for the answer in the AI. They are preparing the AI to eliminate these fake to news from their products like Bing Search Engine and LinkedIn. Microsoft is preparing them self in making sure that they are fighting back.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We are already working on a couple of such AI-powered initiatives towards Bing and Linkedin. We are also trying to forge tie-ups with trusted news sources and then indicate to users what is the source of the news and letting them make their own decisions,” Heiner told IANS at the company’s sprawling. Their major focus is on the censored news and defining which news is fake? Microsoft is also trying to distinguish itself from its rivalry search engine <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wear-os-updates-google-assistant/" target="_blank">Google</a></span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But their rivals are also facing the same problem here. All they want is to deliver the right news and article instead of getting fake trolling news. There they had 2 options to go further. One was to hire more human moderator or implement an AI. Microsoft is trying to overcome from being a second-place search engine. As most of the population depends on Facebook and YouTube for news and information.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">“The whole idea is to build applications around AI in a trustworthy way. People will not share data and they must not be. With respect to users’ privacy, we need trusted AI systems that are safe and transparent,” Heiner added.</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Microsoft is coming here with a different vision. They want to implement an AI that is for all. In this era of technology, <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><a style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/google-machine-learning-ai-make-apps-better/" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence</a></span></strong></span> is one thing that will make impression on society. According to them, a “trustworthy AI” has six factors.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h4>Treat Everyone Fairly</h4>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h4>Must be Safe</h4>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h4>Protect Privacy and Security</h4>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h4>Include Everyone</h4>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h4>Transparent Algorithms</h4>
</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">
<h4>Mysterious at Time</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Heiner came with few more words, “Lastly, people who are deploying AI systems — be it at Microsoft or at other companies — are to be treated as accountable for the trustworthiness of their AI systems.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Different companies are implementing Artificial Intelligence in their products. Their motto is to make their products more advance. But the thing here is that how do you feed data to that AI. This is a big responsibility and Microsoft is very serious about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is hard to say that if the Artificial Intelligence is going to kill many jobs in near future. But one this is we know that is technology have killed some jobs and created new ones. It is not sure if this will be same for AI. But one thing is sure that technology is going to make the impact on jobs again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Machine-Learning1.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4733" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Machine-Learning1.png" alt="Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Nvidia" width="800" height="491" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This application of the Artificial Intelligence can be used from small pace to the big pace. This require system to be that able to analyze all the data and make right decisions. Here human will not make any interaction to manually feed the machine with a decision. It will learn by itself. For example, we can take our daily life example of machine learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-driving car project.</li>
<li>Online Suggestion of products by Application and Browsers.</li>
<li>Fraud and Spam Detection.</li>
</ul>
<p>“A machine learning is the process when a system is taught to learn by itself with the analysis of the data and information fetched while being used.”</p>
<h5>Nvidia on Machine Learning-</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Machine Learning at its most basic is the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.&#8221;</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also have said that it is an idea that came from the mind of AI makers. They worked on the algorithms and decision tree learning. This vision has the best area of work that is computer systems. But still, they need some hand-code to make the system learn things. It is like teaching alphabets to the system first and then let it learn how to read by itself.</p>
<h5>The University of Washington-</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation.&#8221;</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also said that every year there are many algorithms are released by many people. All you have to do here is that finding the right one for you. Analyze what is your system is here for and what it lacks in doing. All you need to do here now is getting the suitable algorithms for this otherwise you will get lost in this very big space of machine learning.</p>
<h4>What makes it different from AI?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Machine Learning is just an <a href="https://hawkscode.com/industries/internet-of-things/">application of Artificial Intelligence</a>. It just a way to achieve AI. Still, you can achieve AI but you will have to work so hard. You need to make decision tree and complex algorithms those will only increase the number of lines in the source code. Machine learning like teaching an algorithm “how”. How the thing gets done, how to use a particular set of data. “Learning” here is resembling that the algorithm will feed on the data and will modify itself. It is like tagging your friend in million of photos then the one-day website will automatically grab the tag. How did that happen? This happened because machine keeps grabbing your data and learned how he looks. So now as you uploaded another picture.</p>
