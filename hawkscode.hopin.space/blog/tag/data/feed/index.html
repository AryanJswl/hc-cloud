<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>



<p>I hope you like this blog <strong>Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components </strong>to learn more visit <strong><a href="http://hawkscode.com"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">HawksCode</span></a></strong> and <a href="http://news.easyshiksha.com"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshiksha</span></strong></a></p>

Data is the Biggest asset of individuals and organizations today. It is more precious than Land and Gold. The importance of data is a well known universal fact, even after that, Personal Data is the most ignored possession among people in developing countries. In this article, we are going to discuss the vital need of Data privacy and implementation of Data protection legal framework.</span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>What is Data Privacy?</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">According to </span></span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/" rel="noindex"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>Wikipedia</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> ,<strong><em>”</em></strong></span></span><strong><em><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Information privacy</span></span></span><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">, or </span></span></span><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">data privacy</span></span></span><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> (or </span></span></span><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">data protection</span></span></span></em></strong><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong><em>), is the relationship between the collection and dissemination of data, technology, the public expectation of privacy, and the legal and political issues surrounding them.”</em></strong> In more simple words, Data privacy is the aspect of having control over your information. Data Privacy refers to the ability to regulate the processing of your data. Your data is private if you and only you can decide the harnessing of your information. Concluding the above, we can say that Data Privacy is a condition where the owner decides the sharing limits of his Data.</span></span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>The Growing Need for Data Privacy </b></span></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Data Protection is not only the concern of individuals of any particular class of the society. It also not belongs to a particular business type or Industry. Both the individuals as well as organizations are the stakeholders of Data Privacy. For Example, a company can have the sensitive data of millions of customers. Similarly, an individual can have personal information like financial data, including bank account and credit card numbers, health and medical records, and even basic, but still personalised sensitive info, such as full names, addresses and birthdates. So, Data privacy is a concern of both Individuals as well as Organization. As an individual, no one wants to share his credit card details by the Bank to third parties. The Personal Identification Number of a person contains all his personal information even biometrics. so protecting it from the unreliable sources becomes the vital need.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There should be a healthy relationship between the Data Principals (whose Data is collected) and the Data fiduciaries (those who process the Data ). The absence of a lawful contract between these two may lead to Data Breach. Data Breach is a condition of sharing of secure and private data with third parties, who may be unfaithful. Recently, Facebook was accused of sharing its user’s data with a third party Cambridge Analytica. They used the personal data of users to affect the General elections in the USA. Similarly, some companies collect the sensitive data of their customers and sell them for market research purposes. The Personal data, which you are ignoring act as a fuel in Business in the age of Data-Driven Marketing. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In India, a hot debate is going on the Privacy of Aadhar Details collected by UIDAI. The Supreme Court of India has also issued a lot of Sensitive Guidelines over Collection of Data and Harnessing it. Recently, Reserve Bank of India has ordered Bharti Airtel and Paytm to stop doing eKYC of its users</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So, we can conclude that access of unlawful bodies to the private data may be hazardous for </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">the data owner in many numbers of ways. Hence, a Data Privacy Legal framework is the essential requirement of society. A regulatory Body should exist in every country which can monitor the harnessing of Data and its Collection.</span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5110" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends.jpg" alt="Google, Trends, SEO, Data, Work" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends.jpg 1280w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Google-Trends-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>Before 2006, we were unable to know what people are interested in or if something big has happened. Google Trends is world’s largest real time search data set. On this tool, one can have access to what people are searching in different regions of the world. Every year trillions of the search query are generated and Google keeps storing and analyzing the data. So if anything big happened you can interpret the news with Google Trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might look similar to the Google Keyword Planner but what it shows is a popularity over the time. There is a big difference here when it comes to long-term trending keywords and short term. If you are writing blogs that trend for a while go for keywords those are trending in present time. But if you are planning to keep your web page trending then go for long term keywords.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>What is Google Trends Data?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The data that Google trends have is an unbiased data that is searched by billions of people from around the world. This data categorized, do not identify persons and well arranged. This allows Trend user to go with searches those are trending from worldwide to city-geography. You can manually make search too of your favorite topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is two way of time zone filter. One is Real time Filter. Real time filter picks the data for query form last 7 days. On the other hand, there is Non-real time filter. This can go back to 2004 or ~36 hours back. The query can be random or whatever you like to search. Both can’t be viewed together. Both have a different set of queries that lies in a different set of time zone.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How to Work with Trends?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we said earlier, Trends and Keyword Planner both show different data and both have different meanings. Now if you combine the data of Trends and Keyword planner you will get a better understanding of your keywords. With the help of Trends, you will know what will your potential future market. It also saves your business trip expenses for the business. Trends will let you know how trending your services are in particular country or region. So before making the trip, cross check the data with trends.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How Trends works for SEO?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Google Trends doesn’t give actual search numbers, it works best when used in combination with the Keyword Planner. Google Trends will show a “normalized” or relative level of interest over time for a prospective keyword phrase. It also allows you to compare the level of interest among potential target phrases. It also breakdowns the geo tagging by the ‘search by region’. Also, it is a big help in regional or local SEO. When it comes to content writing trends let you know what people are interested in. So grab the combine it with some keywords and your post is going to flourish with great traffic and top rank.</p>
