<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about the how to create wireframes for your application. Wireframes are the base of any application. </p>



<p>Regardless of how excellent your idea for a&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;is, if you don’t know where to start and how to go about it, it will fail. Our consistent response to such confusion is – wireframe!</p>



<p style="font-size:0"><strong><span style="color:#27aae2" class="has-inline-color">Wireframing</span></strong> is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on the way client want to see your application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Wireframe Show?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, it’s a two-dimensional skeleton of what your future mobile app will look like. It shows:</p>



<ul><li>Content prioritization</li><li>Space distribution</li><li>Intended actions</li><li>Available features and functions</li><li>Transitions between screens</li></ul>



<p><strong>Wireframes</strong> can drawn on paper, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your <strong>website or product</strong>. In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:</p>



<ul><li>Wireframe &gt; Interactive Prototype &gt; Visual &gt; Design</li><li>Sketch &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Hi-Def Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Integral Aspects of a Website</h2>



<p>In the beginning focus on integral aspects of a website. Firstly don’t even consider the design aesthetics for now. The colors, themes, fonts, and images can be taken care of later.</p>



<p>You must have a clear understanding of the features you need in your final product.&nbsp;Prepare a list and include all the things you actually need in your app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to aim at excellent user experience with your app. What’s the first thing users will see after launching your app? How will this screen guide them for further navigation? How can users take specific actions? Is it going to be easier for them to figure out?</p>



<p>UX can be abstract and complicated. Because, just like everything else on the Internet, the UX is also evolving at a tremendous pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now you are ready to start putting these ideas down. </h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to use pen and paper to start designing your UX, UI when there are tonnes of applications available in the market which that you can easy build one for you. </p>



<p>Now before ending this I want to share some tools name that can be very useful for building wireframes.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><strong>Balsmiq</strong>, <strong>draw.io</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>, <strong>Figma</strong> are the free tools available online. You can easily start working on these start putting your ideas and start building your application.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Web development is a major unit when you are into business. It plays a vital role if you are into expanding more or stable. The website remains with you all the time. So what a website perform for you:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a service showcase template that highlights what your company can do.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A website lists you online with public access on the most search engine.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a self-promotional practice.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Through the blog, you can share your opinion with the world.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is a service offering proposal with text and other media.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Services like SEO let you help see who and how your customer are performing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are just some little highlights what website can do. A business needs to have wed developer or support of <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development company</a></strong></span>. This support or collaboration may run for a long time but it is important. So when you select a company or web developer make sure you know them well. It not a one-time thing that you do and is done for all. It is a way of conversation with your customer and future clients.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Development never Ends:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a business asks “How long will it take to complete the website?”. Websites are rarely static now. Most of the data is dynamic and it is hard to complete while small things will keep on updating. So if small business keeps on asking when will it get done then answer is it will go on. It is not a one time process that gets done after a time. Language or technology it is developed on keeps on changing with time so do website need to be. To keep up with the trends and opportunity website development need to run time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now you need to invest wisely in this. You make sure that you don’t go with cheaper one to save money. As this is a long process it may be going cost in future. Also, don’t go with one with much price in first place. Make sure that you have a technical help like a friend or relative from the same background. Their review and knowledge will help you in choosing the right one for your business. Or you make contact with several developers or <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">website development company</a></strong></span>. Now you have a full information about them you can make a full analysis on your own. This will narrow down option for you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></span> are important in Website Development:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s suppose your website has all the functionality and working done perfectly. But, what is the point if it cannot attract users or make them stay. Here design and experience play a vital role. Designs are what attract your potential client. A good <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">Website design company</a></strong></span> will be a big help here. Still, you have to take care of some points those may harm your conversion with your client.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Large size media and content, like video and code, make your website heavy to load in the browser. That also slow downloading speed of a website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not put so much animation or heavy graphics that takes time to load. What is a good point in making a website that user doesn’t pay attention to? If your user doesn’t have good patience then he will move to another service provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All your content needs to be responsive and optimized. You can take help from <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/digital-marketing/seo/" target="_blank">SEO team</a></strong></span> to make sure that your website is well optimized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attractive is not enough, make it interactive and initiative. Your website must force your user to keep on browsing it and see all your service. A website must make impression on the user. They need to remember you for your services. It is the way make them return.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management is Necessary:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do development without any plan then it has more chance that you will fail at some points or you will make mistake. Make it possible that before starting a project you have a better plan for everything. If things go with a plan it goes in a very optimized way. It controls everything like cost, resources, content and other related things. Make sure that you are active at the current time. Being in a managed way will help you in managing the content of the website. By these update, a user will know how updated and managed you are. They know that you are available for users. Management help development team to do their work in very confident and in a comfortable manner.</p>
