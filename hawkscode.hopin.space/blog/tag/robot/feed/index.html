<p>Medical robots to the rescue in the battle against Covid 19. The Covid-19 pandemic may have brought the world to a standstill, but scientists and innovators are leaving no stone unturned to aid those who are at the forefront of this fight. Countries around the world are looking at all sorts of technologies to aid the long battle against the deadly coronavirus.</p>



<p> The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/coronavirus-robot-dog-enforces-social-distancing-singapore-park/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robot</span></strong></a> can record all activities using its in-built 3D and HD cameras, and also enables doctors and nurses to interact with patients remotely, even aiding communication between patients and their family members via a 10-inch screen. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Humanoid</span></strong></a> ELF has at least 60 sensors and runs on a battery that can last up to eight hours, with an auto-charge feature. “Milagrow is very happy to support AIIMS in its fight against the pandemic and will work closely to develop more products based on the feedback. As the outbreak continues to rise alarmingly, the robots will help check the virus spread and protect doctors, nurses and caregivers from getting infected,” Rajeev Karwal, founder and chairman, Milagrow, said.</p>



<p><ins></ins></p>



<p>Additionally, AIIMS Delhi will also deploy Milagrow iMap 9, a floor-cleaning robot that can move independently and sanitise floors without human intervention. The robot uses a sodium hypochlorite solution to kill any Covid-19 spores on floor surfaces. Milagrow’s patented Real-Time Terrain Recognition Technology (RT2RT) scans all 360-degree angles and does it six times per second to make a floor map in real-time. This enables the iMap 9 to perform successfully in the first attempt as opposed to other robots which take twice or thrice the amount of time.</p>



<p>AIIMS is not the only hospital, however, where robotics are being used. A Jaipur hospital is reportedly in talks with many robotics companies for a robot that can deliver medicines and food to patients in isolation wards. The district Covid-19 centre in Ancharakkandi in Kerala’s Kannur has also deployed robots to assist health workers in caring for patients. Named Nightingale-19, the robot has been designed by students of Vimal Jyoti Engineering College in Chemberi, Kannur, and can carry food and water weighing up to 25 kg at a time. It can be controlled from a distance of 1 km.</p>



<p>Futuristic technology, combined with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/impact-of-ai-on-our-daily-life/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence</span></strong></a>, is helping scientists and health workers identify the symptoms of coronavirus, find new treatments and track its spread across the world.</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about Will robots and AI take our jobs in covid-19’s socially distanced era? Coronavirus has put a rocket below plans for extra automation, roboticisation and use of AI. Ought to we worry for our jobs – or will we simply get higher ones?</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a fundamental impact on the global labour market in the next few years. Therefore, the authors discuss legal, economic and business issues, such as changes in the future labour market and in company structures, impact on working time, remuneration and on the working environment, new forms of employment and the impact on labour relations.</p>



<p>At many places you can see clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst<strong> UV Bot, with its 1000 watts’ </strong>worth of UVC light capable of “tearing apart strands of virus DNA”, comes here every night, as well as to a few other<strong> malls and hospitals in Singapore</strong>. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the covid-19 pandemic: cleaning.</p>



<p>Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals, Moxi delivers medications, lab samples and supplies. P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets. James the telepresence bot helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking the coronavirus’s genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.</p>



<p>This trend towards automation and roboticisation isn’t new – but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. “What this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance”, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. “In these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.”</p>



<p>And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone – with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?</p>



<p>So is there any solution to this problem is Robot is going to capture the market which will lead to unemployment. But yes in today&#8217;s time it is difficult to get a robot for petty works because it&#8217;s costing is too high but yes in future we are going to totally rely on robots for petty work also.</p>
