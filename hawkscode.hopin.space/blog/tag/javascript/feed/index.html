<p>Introduction to D3.js for data visualization. D3.js is a JavaScript library used to manipulate documents based on data. It uses HTML, CSS, and SVG to create visual representations of data which can be viewed on any modern browser. it is a&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;tool.</p>



<p>Create a folder named&nbsp;<strong>d3js_projects</strong>. Create an HTML file in the folder named&nbsp;<strong>project_1.html</strong>.&nbsp; You can also learn about&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/">Easyshiksha Certification</a></strong></p>



<p>create a simple html web page</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;title&gt;My first page&lt;/title&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;body&gt; Web Page&lt;/body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>after this just setup D3.js with this code in head element. Rember one thing script code will be written in head elament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;script&nbsp;type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&nbsp;src=&#8221;d3.v2.min.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="310" height="163" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5563" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png 310w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After this setup the source</strong></h2>



<p>To test our D3.js setup we open the inspect element tool kit.</p>



<p>In the element tab of webkit Inspector, we open all of the elements so that we can see the whole HTML structure.&nbsp;we then hover over the d3.vs.min.js src.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOM Section</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;Using D3.js, we can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), meaning we can select elements and apply various transformations on the data visualization.</p>



<p><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;Learn D3 in 5 minutes&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Today is a beautiful day!!&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;script src='https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;<br>d3.select('h3').style('color', 'darkblue');<br>d3.select('h3').style('font-size', '24px');&lt;/script&gt;<br><br></code></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">select method is used to make manupulations and or add data in a element.</h2>



<p>So we’re simply chaining the&nbsp;<code>select()</code>&nbsp;method on the&nbsp;<code>d3</code>&nbsp;object, and then following up with&nbsp;<code>style()</code>. The first parameter dictates what we want to change and the second gives the value. Here’s the result:</p>



<p>The next concept you’ll need to learn is data binding, as that’s one of the coolest features of D3. Using it, we can populate or manipulate DOM elements in real-time. Introduction to D3.js for data visualization</p>



<p>In our HTML, we have a simple unordered list&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>ul&gt;:&nbsp; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>



<p>We want to create the list elements using a data object. Here’s the code for doing exactly that:</p>



<p>&lt;script&gt;</p>



<p>var languages=[&#8216;java&#8217;, &#8216;python&#8217;, &#8216;javascript&#8217;, &#8216;c++&#8217;];</p>



<p>d3.select(&#8220;ul&#8221;) //firstly we will select the ul</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp; .selectAll(&#8220;li&#8221;) //now we are selecting all the data is li as a array. but li is no present in code</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp;.data(languages) //language is the array passed in data it will run up to 4 times</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; .enter() // enter will check if li is present or not</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;.append(&#8220;li&#8221;) // with append we will add li</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"> .text(function(d){return d;});&nbsp;</h5>



<p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p>In today&#8217;s blog we are going to talk about Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It. Jordan Walke, a former employee at Facebook, developed ReactJS. It’s an open source JavaScript library that is utilized to create user interfaces for single page apps.</p>



<p>Since it requires only a minimal understanding of HTML and JavaScript, React has risen in popularity as a front-end web development tool.</p>



<p>Without reloading web pages, developers can make certain changes in web app data. The features or purpose of this is to be easy, efficient, and quick in making a user interface for apps.</p>



<p>Here is : Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thing which is exceptional about React JS</strong></h2>



<p>It can be easily guessed that React is not similar to other popular frameworks, like Angular or Ember. So unlike others, it is, in fact, small, developed on the concept of components and functions properly with other frameworks as well as libraries such as JQuery, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rich User Interface</strong></h2>



<p>In this era, customers expert more then static HTML website from you. It is important to provide quality without load time, performance and other factor. React Js gives you everything you need to build web applications with rich user-interfaces that can promise exceptional user experiences. User-interfaces being very crucial for the success of your business, you can easily build cool UI using declarative components.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reusable Components</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="875" height="492" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g.png" alt="Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It " class="wp-image-5693" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g.png 875w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-300x169.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-768x432.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-696x391.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-747x420.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" /></figure>



<p>React provides a component based structure. You start with tiny components like button, checkbox, dropdown etc. and the you create wrapper components composed of those smaller components. And then you write higher level wrapper components. And, it goes on like that until you have this one root component and that component is your app.</p>



<p>Each component decides how it should be rendered. Each component has its own internal logic. This approach has some amazing results. You can re-use components anywhere you need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Testing and Functionality</strong></h2>



<p>Developers can use the ReactJS framework for browsing ecmascript6 modules that define reliance and can utilize it with Babel, reacts-di, etc. These are simple to test and can be treated as the present state’s function.</p>



<p>They can be monitored from the triggered functions, output, events, etc. You need to test prior to using and React JS definitely makes it very easy for doing it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ease of Migration</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike Google’s Angular framework, which had faced a very alarming compatibility issue between version 1.x and 2.0, the ReactJS library supports a wide range of codebases and can be mixed into any existing infrastructure without shutting down the system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="b01b">Clean Abstraction</h2>



<p>One of the powerful sides of React is that it provides a good abstraction which means that it does not expose any complex internals to the user.</p>



<p>Compare this to Angular: Why on earth should you have to learn an internal process such as digest cycles? Those kind of details better be kept as internals to provide a clean abstraction. You only need to understand a component’s life cycles, states and props to master React to accomplish everything you need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strong community support</strong></h2>



<p>Like Angular, React also has very strong community support, which is one of the main reasons to adopt React JS in your project.</p>



<p>Every day, a large number of individual React developers are contributing towards making React a better frontend framework. Currently, React JS has attained 136.079 starts on Github and 1,331 regular contributors.</p>

<p>7 JavaScript Tricks learn in less than 5 min. JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages at the moment. avaScript is the number one programming language in the world, the language of the web, of mobile hybrid apps (like PhoneGap or Appcelerator), of the server side (like NodeJS or Wakanda) and has many other implementations. You can also learn more about <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/websites-for-learning-javascript/">JavaScript</a></span></strong> and complete <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Complete-JavaScript-Programming-Start-to-End">guide to JavaScript</a></strong>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to learn the tricks and shortcut in javascript and you need to invest less than 5 min.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create an array with unique values using the “Set” object</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Imagine a array with a duplicate item and you want to show only unique items. You could try writing a <em>map</em> or <em>filter </em>to achieve this. Alternatively, ES6 introduces the <strong><em>Set object</em></strong>, which solves this problem in just 1 line of code.

const uniqueItemsarray = [...new Set([1, 2, 3, 3,])]</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create Empty Objects</h2>



<p>Sure you can create an object that seems empty with <code>{}</code>, but that object still has a <code>__proto__</code> and the usual <code>hasOwnProperty</code> and other object methods. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">let dict = Object.create(null);</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Merge Several Objects Together</h2>



<p>There is always a need to merge in javascript the need to merge two or more classes, and this was my go-to approach. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">const student = { 
 name: 'John Wick', 
 gender: 'Male' 
 };const school = { 
 primary: 'St Xavier School', 
 secondary: 'Paul Secondary School' 
 };const skills = { 
 programming: 'Extreme', 
 swimming: 'Average', 
 sleeping: 'Pro' 
 };const summary = {...user, ...college, ...skills};</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using the window.location object</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="422" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript.jpg" alt="7 JavaScript Tricks learn in less than 5 min " class="wp-image-5557" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript.jpg 750w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript-746x420.jpg 746w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p>JavaScript can access the current URL using the <strong>window.location </strong>object. Pretty neat, but even cooler is that this object contains certain parts of the URL as well. 7 JavaScript Tricks learn in less than 5 min.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// JavaScript can access the current URL in parts. For this URL:
`https://thatsanegg.com/example/index.html?s=article`window.location.protocol == `https:`
window.location.host == `thatsanegg.com`
window.location.pathname == `/example/index.html`
window.location.search == `?s=article`</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Avoid negative indexes in arrays</strong></h2>



<p>This is a simple trick of avoiding negative indexes </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>var numbersArray = &#91;1,2,3,4,5]; 
var from = numbersArray.indexOf("foo") ;  // from is equal to -1 
numbersArray.splice(from,2);    // will return &#91;5]</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Destructuring with Aliases</h2>



<p>The <strong>destructuring assignment</strong> syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">const object = { number: 10 };
const { number } = object;// Grabbing number and renaming it as otherNumber
const { number: otherNumber } = object;console.log(otherNumber);</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pass functions, not strings, to <code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code></strong></h2>



<p>If you pass a string into <code>setTimeout()</code> or <code>setInterval()</code>, the string will be evaluated the same way as with <code>eval</code>, which is slow. Instead of using…</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>setInterval('doSomethingChronologically()', 1000);  
setTimeout('doSomethingAfterFiveSeconds()', 
5000);
setInterval(doSomethingPeriodically, 1000);  
setTimeout(doSomethingAfterFiveSeconds, 5000);</code></pre>

In the market at present, many package managers are wondering few are good for the work. It is hard when we find people are confused and feeling frustrated while selecting package manager. So we have decided to let&#8217;s make some talk about these. There are so many of these managers. But here we will be listing 5 package managers those you can use while doing front end development.</p>
<h3>1. NPM<a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NPM.jpeg"><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;"><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>This one is taken as Node Package Manager and even called the same. But if that so what is the meaning of listing it here. It is also manager of world’s largest software registry. You can manage public and private code with the same workflow. It holds the largest collection of free and reusable codes. It can be used for frontend web apps, mobile apps, robots and routers. Usage Package: Free, $7 per user/ month, $16 per user/month. </p>
<h3>2. Yarn</h3>
<p><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yarn-1024x3771.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4720" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yarn-1024x3771-1024x377.jpeg" alt="yarn package manager" width="640" height="236" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yarn-1024x3771.jpeg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yarn-1024x3771-300x110.jpeg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Yarn-1024x3771-696x256.jpeg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a> <strong>Twitter of Yarn: </strong><a class="twitter-mention-button" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=yarnpkg&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-show-count="false">Tweet to @yarnpkg</a> This package was first initiated by the Facebook and is supported by the Google. It uses caching mode to make fast and quick development. It downloads every code as a cache so you don’t need to download it again and again. Its server use queues up request so that it can handle the bulk of request. It keeps checking packages after every installation to avoid corrupt packages. </p>
<h3>3. Bower</h3>
<p><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bowser-1024x3771.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4719" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bowser-1024x3771-1024x377.jpeg" alt="Bower Package Manager" width="640" height="236" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bowser-1024x3771.jpeg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bowser-1024x3771-300x110.jpeg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bowser-1024x3771-696x256.jpeg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a> <strong>First Commit:</strong> September 6, 2012</p>

<p><script src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" async="" charset="utf-8"></script>It share a great reputation on GitHub and have highest stars than any other package managers. But don’t get blinded by its starts only. It surely is very useful and that’s why it earned the respect. When Bower first created, NPM was already present in the market. So what was the need of making of Bower? NPM only handle node.js and do not include a browser. Bower came into the market by eliminating this problem.</p>
