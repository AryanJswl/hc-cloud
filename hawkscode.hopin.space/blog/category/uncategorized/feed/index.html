<p><strong>Combining python and d3.js to create dynamic visualization applications</strong><em>. D3.js</em>, a powerful library that enables you to build customized&nbsp;visualisations for any kind of storytelling you could imagine for the web.&nbsp;Problem solving through data analysis and programming, on the other hand, is still very much rooted in the linear perspective, since they involve a step by step breakdown of data to understand and solve a problem. However, data analysis when done correctly allows a user to account for minute details and idiosyncrasies that are usually missed when looking at the whole picture. Combing a data driven approach along with a more visual oriented approach provides a holistic approach to problem solving and analysis that combines linear and non-linear perspectives.</p>



<p>What I will demonstrate is how a user can effectively create a data processing back end in python while maintaining a visual front end in&nbsp;<strong>d3.js</strong>&nbsp;to create an effective application. We will also add some controllable features so that the front end and the back end can communicate with each other effectively on the basis of inputs from the final user. The python module we will use is ‘Flask’ which will act as the intermediary between the back end and the front end. The d3 visualization I have chosen is the&nbsp;collapsible bar chart&nbsp;example created by Mike Bostock. Creation of the&nbsp;<strong>visualization structure</strong>&nbsp;will involve some use of html, js and some jinja code.&nbsp;Combining python and d3.js to create dynamic visualization applications.</p>



<p><strong>&nbsp;Defining the structure of the application</strong></p>



<p>What we will be doing, is create a front end on a html page which will host our visualization and d3.js scripts. We will send the data to this html page from python code contained in a file called&nbsp;<strong>‘application.py’</strong>. The structure of the application on the computer will be as follows.<br><br>First, let’s design the front end which will be a basic html page (“index.html”) which will host our d3 visualization along with a form where a user can submit a<br>country and year selection. The final html is hosted&nbsp;here.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;input name=”Country_field” placeholder=”Enter country name” &gt; &lt;input type=”number” name=”Year_field” placeholder=”Enter Year” &gt; &lt;input type=”submit” value=”Submit Country and Year” &gt; &lt;/form&gt;</pre>



<p>Now, we will create two divisions, one to host the production data graph on the left and one to host the loss data on the right. The divisions should also display the country and the year selected. We will have to specify ids for the graphs and will have to write out some code in jinja to get the country name and the year.&nbsp;Combining python and d3.js to create dynamic visualization applications</p>



<p>We will have to repeat the same code to create another division for the loss data.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Third step is creating backend in Python</strong></p>



<p>The steps in creating the python file are a bit more time consuming. The final application file is available&nbsp;here. We will need to perform the following steps,</p>



<p>1. Import neccessary packages, define the application in flask and create a datastore.</p>



<p>2. Create the code to generate data to send to the front end for the home page.</p>



<p>3. Convert data into json format for d3 and send the same to the front end</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="451" height="301" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5501" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-3.png 451w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-3-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" /></figure></div>



<p>Content takes up quite a lot of space when one has to analyze the importance of all the elements that make up the web of SEO techniques. Anyone who has been associated with Search Engine Optimization knows that content is always the king. It plays a pivotal role in establishing your website’s authority and pushes your site to a rank on Google’s SERPs, where it has the convenience of visibility. Of course, that is not all that a site requires to be ranked on Google; there are several other metrics. But, what we mean to point out with this is that content occupies a significant amount of space in the entire domain of SEO. And that is why it is extremely important to market the content well. There is no point developing the content of your website without putting in the required amount of research. The point is simply lost on the developers then. We shall, therefore, look into what content marketing is, and also look into all the ways in which you can go about your content marketing strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>So What Exactly Do We Mean By Content Marketing?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Content marketing is the process of creating content in the most relevant way possible, as a means to grab the required attention from Google and the target audience. That is the simplest definition of this digital marketing technique. And since it involves the term ‘marketing’ in it, it is clear that content marketing aims at marketing the content in the best way possible. However, it is not done just with the intention of selling a particular idea or acquiring conversions and new leads. Content marketing, in some cases, also aims at enlightening the target audience about some product, service or issue. In a nutshell, content marketing is the technique of adding some kind of value to your customers and enhancing their user experience. Once you are able to improve the user experience, your website gets recognized by Google, and you can then up your rank on the search engine’s results page. Several guest posts, which are a great SEO hack, also use the same content marketing trick to make business. And the best part of this entire process is that, you can always&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://serpninja.io/guest-posts/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">buy guest posts</span></strong></a>&nbsp;from a good SEO agency and ease up on the process of content marketing to find a suitable rank on Google.</p>



<p><strong>What Are Some of the Best Ways of Content Marketing?</strong></p>



<p>There are several ways in which you can market your content. And in this section, we shall be discussing on the all those ways so that the next time you go about the process, you can do so with enough knowledge on your side.</p>



<p><strong>Understand the Market Well-</strong></p>



<p>It all begins with acquiring holistic information on the market in which you are competing. Content marketing requires you to dive deep into the market and analyze your competition. How else do you presume to understand the pulse of the market? Look at all the factors that drive your competitors and see how they have been acquiring leads and conversions. Check their websites for loopholes in their content so that you can use the knowledge to your benefit. Understanding the market is the first step to content marketing, and you must do it well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5495" width="572" height="382" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png 451w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px" /></figure>



<p>&nbsp;<strong>Target the Right Keywords-</strong></p>



<p>The next step is to target the right keywords so that you do not stray away from your market. You must invest a good deal of effort in researching the right keywords in your niche. Targeting the right keywords in your niche shall help you develop content in a way that will help you optimize for the search engines and create content that adds value to the search of your users. And that is how you are going to end up at a higher rank on the SERPs. Keyword research is an integral and perhaps the most important part of the entire content marketing process, and it is essential that you pay quite some attention to it. If you go wrong here, you will go wrong in other places too.</p>



<p><strong>Develop Content-</strong></p>



<p>Now that you have targeted the right keywords, what you must do is create content around those keywords, and you must do it well. The better you target your keywords and create content around them, the better will you be able to grab Google’s and your user’s attention. But remember that it is not enough to just add keywords for the heck of it. You must optimize the content well in every other way. For instance, you can add multimedia so that it adds more contexts and enhances the user experience.</p>



<p><strong>In a Nutshell:</strong></p>



<p>Content marketing is not as difficult as it seems. You can always end up creating the right content for your website if you know how to go about the process. All you have to do is invest time and effort in research and come up with innovative ways to optimize your content. That should just do the trick.  <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://enticehq.com/blog/content-development/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">The 7 step Content Development Process to Grow</span></a></p>

<p>As we all know that all the globe is in Lockdown due to novel coronavirus, the pandemic. Most of the public sector and private services are in Lockdown and if you think information technology is free from it then You are wrong……</p>



<p>Most of the top companies in the <strong>IT (Information Technology)</strong> sector including <strong><a href="http://www.hawkscode.com">HawksCode</a></strong>, <strong>Infosys</strong>, <strong>Wipro</strong>, <strong>TCS</strong> and many more were gone under lockdown for the last few months and still don&#8217;t know the future.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>&#8220;THE IT SECTOR IS THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC BONE OF ANY COUNTRY&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>The economy </em></strong>is the most dangerous issue in the world during covid_19 and for cop-up with this most of the IT, firms decided to apply for <strong>work from home on their employees</strong>. </p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>But now the question is what type of technology we use amid covid_19.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Technology plays an important role in the world and now in the time of lockdown, its role is more important. We have discussed some points on how to use technology during lockdown especially in the <strong>Information Technology</strong> sector. </p>



<ol><li><strong>Use Skype &#8211; </strong>Skype is one of the best ways to be in touch with your clients and employees during the lockdown, one can communicate with others and share all the information and details with one another.</li><li><strong>Zoom &#8211; </strong>Zoom is another platform where one can conduct video conference or so-called <strong>webinar</strong> for meetings and conferences. </li><li><strong>Google Drive &#8211; </strong>Google drive is one of the best ways to share your data with others, it is the free source provided by Google. </li><li><strong>Artificial Intelligence  (AI) &#8211; </strong>This New Technology is the best way to deal with work without human efforts. Many devices nowadays are accessible to most of our efforts.. Few examples like Alexa, Google voice, eco, etc.. </li><li><strong>Cloud Computing &#8211; </strong>It&#8217;s the old trend now to save all the data in files and brochures, now most of the data have been stored in cloud only. It is the best way to store data and one can access the data from anywhere in the world.</li><li>Broadcast &#8211; broadcast is the fastest way to share the details and data with the employees, so in mid of lockdown, the broadcast will play an important role. </li></ol>



<p><strong>Coronavirus</strong> is the most dangerous pandemic in the world now., it is spread already across the globe and economy is affected by it. So the information technology sector plays an important role.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Factors that Affect SEO</h2>



<p> So now you know what is SEO and how it works. Take a look at both on-page and off-page factors that impact search engine results page rankings.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"> 1. Content Marketing</h3>



<p>Content marketing is the most effective way of attracting search engines and helping you to make connections with your website visitors.</p>



<p>Writing quality content will help your website in many ways. The more relevant and quality content it is, the more likely search engines will be to rank your pages higher on SERP.</p>



<p>Similarly, the more effective and engaging your content is, the more visitors will spend some quality time on your website which may convert into a purchase.</p>



<p>You should write content including your keywords. Try to focus on long-tail keywords at first as they are good at the beginning. Content should not be copied from other websites and completely describing your business or product. Incomplete information leads to misconceptions.</p>



<p>Types of content you can publish and improve your search engine rankings:</p>



<ul><li>Articles and blog posts.Videos and audio</li><li>Social media content</li><li>Infographics</li><li>How-to Guides and Tutorials</li><li>Other visual content</li></ul>



<p> Creating fresh content is key. Fresh content does not mean that you have to write daily but it means that you can repost your previous blogs. Edit them or update them and make it fresh for your audience. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. On-Page SEO</h3>



<p>On-page SEO refers to all the practices done on the web pages in order to rank them higher on search engines. In simple words, all the elements which happen on your website come under on-page SEO. Content marketing is not the only factor but it also consists of your website&#8217;s HTML.</p>



<p>You have complete control over your website&#8217;s on-page SEO.</p>



<p>Have a look at some important on-page SEO factors that can help you improve your search engine ranking:</p>



<p><strong>Title Tag&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> The title of your page tells what your page is about. Your title should be of 50-70 characters with space. The primary keyword should be present in the title before the separator. An eye-catchy title will help you in getting traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Meta Description&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> It is basically a summary of your page. It tells search engines and human visitors about your page. The meta description should not be more than 160 characters and its optimum length is 125 characters. The focus keyword is very important in the Meta description.</p>



<p><strong>Sub-headings&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> Your page should contain several headings. Headings not only make your content easy to read but it also helps your website&#8217;s SEO. You can use many heading tags like H1, H2, H3 and so on. Under one heading don&#8217;t write more than 300 words.</p>



<p><strong>Image Name and ALT tags&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> People do not consider it important but it is as much important as other things are. If you are using images in your blog post then adding keywords in the image name and alt attribute helps search engines to index your image for a particular keyword.</p>



<p><strong>Internal Links&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> Internal links help search engines to know more about your site. Internal linking means linking within the website. Link your other products or services within your blog.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Off-Page SEO</h3>



<p>You will have complete control on on-page SEO but here on off-page SEO, you don&#8217;t have any direct control. Still, you can improve it in some ways. Work done for your website on other websites is known as off-page SEO in easy terms.</p>



<p><strong>Some off-page SEO factors for your website:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Social&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> One important factor is social signals, such as likes and shares. It&#8217;s easy for you if you get some quality shares on your content. It will make you reach much wider.</p>



<p><strong>Links&nbsp;&#8211;</strong> The most popular way in off-page SEO is crating backlinks of your website. It will boost your SEO very easily. You should be very careful while creating backlinks as your website can get spammed very easily because of this method. Build links on good websites having a good SEO score.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Black Hat vs. White Hat SEO</h4>



<p>There are two different approaches that companies have to take for optimizing their sites for the search engines.</p>



<p>Black hat SEO focusses on optimizing content only for search engines and not for human visitors. It may help in ranking on search engines very quickly but they often get banned by search engines.</p>



<p>White hat SEO is the opposite and it involves optimizing for the human audience that will be reading and clicking the site&#8217;s content. It&#8217;s a more effective tactic in the long run.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How SEO works for small Businesses: Final Outcome</h2>



<p>Now you know how SEO works, you can easily optimize your website and boost your rankings on search engines.</p>



<p>Always remember that there are a lot of factors that impact the SEO of your site but providing the right content to the relevant audience is most important. SEO is not magic as it does not shows its results overnight. It may take months to show results.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, picture dimensions, and scripting abilities. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The concept of Responsive Web </b><b>Design</b> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Responsive web design becomes quite clear if you take a moment to analyze and understand the intricacies of </span>the contemporary<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> net and mobile technology, and implementing responsive design is simpler than you may think. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The number of those devices has increased exponentially, which in turn has improved the variety of browsers specifications and display resolutions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">There is a wide variety of information on responsive web design available all over the Internet, and a lot of </span>information<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> is abstract, philosophical, and anecdotal. If you&#8217;re looking for a tidy, concrete understanding of the base of responsive web design, it comes down to below methods that all work in conjunction: </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5371" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design.jpg" alt="Responsive web design" width="1600" height="958" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design.jpg 1600w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-300x180.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-768x460.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-1024x613.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-696x417.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-1068x639.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responsive-web-design-701x420.jpg 701w" sizes="(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px" />Fluid Images</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">There are a couple issues that crop up with flexible media but the biggest issue is around ratio that&#8217;s a knock-on effect from defining height and width on the component itself. Since the viewport grows larger the contained image/video/iframe grows wider too, which means that it needs to grow taller also. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">What&#8217;s the best method to design a website that will be looked at on countless different display sizes, some of which might not even exist yet? The ideal approach is not one comprising catering to specific devices; it&#8217;s one that more generally makes your layout scalable, adaptive, and adaptable to screens of all sizes, even sizes which are yet to become popular. </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>There are few points to make it responsive &#8211;</b> </span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If the maximum width of the image is set to 100 percent of the screen width or the browser then the overall screening width diminishes, the image will scale down proportionally. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Another method that aims not just to resize images, but also to decrease the resolution of images on smaller devices in order to not waste space, loading time, and expensive mobile bandwidth on more small mobile screens. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Media Queries</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Media Queries are possibly the most important tool a web designer has to create their sites </span>responsively<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5372" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries.jpg" alt="Concept and Principles of Responsive Web Design" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries.jpg 1200w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-768x432.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Media-Queries-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" />This set of rules enables developers to create fluid layouts that accommodate without distortion or loss of quality to the viewer&#8217;s device. It is great to point out that this set of guidelines (or principles) ought to be stored in a separate CSS stylesheet from the one where there are those for the general style (which is usually named style.css). </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Media questions help take into consideration multiple display possibilities and, as a result, the organized style rules can be modified quickly and easily. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>P</b><b>rinciples of </b><b>R</b><b>esponsive </b><b>W</b><b>eb </b><b>D</b><b>esign</b> </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Responsive website design is a great solution to our multi-screen problem, but getting into it in the printing standpoint is difficult. No page size, no millimeters or inches, regardless of actual limitations to resist against. Designing in pixels for Desktop and Mobile just is also the past, as a growing number of gadgets may open up a website. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Therefore, let&#8217;s clarify some basic principles of responsive web design here in order to adopt the fluid web, instead of fighting it. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Proper use of Breakpoints</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Breakpoints allow the layout to change at predefined factors, i.e. having 3 columns on a desktop, but just 1 column onto a mobile device. Most CSS properties could be changed from 1 breakpoint into another. Usually where you put one is determined by the content. If a sentence breaks, then you might have to add a breakpoint. But use them with caution &#8212; it may get cluttered quickly when it&#8217;s difficult to understand what&#8217;s affecting what. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5373" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design.png" alt="Concept and Principles of Responsive Web Design" width="1024" height="689" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-300x202.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-768x517.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-696x468.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Principles-of-Responsive-Web-Design-624x420.png 624w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" />Fluid Grids</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">When a design is coded in relative proportions of the components on the webpage, this layout is known as a &#8220;fluid grid&#8221;. Traditionally, a CSS layout uses fixed width grids to place each element online page. This fixed-width approach is no longer viable today since there are many displays, from phone screens to HDTV displays. Now, each component is given a relative size or percent instead of particular heights and widths. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Mobile or Desktop First</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Technically there isn&#8217;t a great deal of difference if a job is started from a smaller display to a bigger or vice versa. Yet it provides additional limitations and makes it possible to make decisions if you start with mobile. Frequently people start from both ends at once, so really, go and see what works best for you. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Accessibility </span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Every single consumer should be able to get every single piece of information on your page in the simplest manner possible. The text ought to be readable on all display sizes. The colors should be appealing, yet not harsh on the eyes. Do not let the content be overpowered by the background. The plan should have visual harmony and balance with all the color scheme as well as contrast. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Nested objects</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Remember the comparative position? With a lot of elements based on each other would be difficult to control. So, wrapping elements in a container retain it way more clear, tidy and clean. This is where static units like pixels can help. They are useful for articles that you don&#8217;t wish to scale, like logos and buttons. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Bitmap images vs Vectors</b> </span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5374" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bitmap-images-vs-Vectors.jpg" alt="Concept and Principles of Responsive Web Design" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bitmap-images-vs-Vectors.jpg 600w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Bitmap-images-vs-Vectors-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />Is it true that your icon </span>possess<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> a lot of details and some fancy effects applied? If yes, use a bitmap. If not, consider employing a vector picture. Each has some advantages and some drawbacks. However, remember the dimensions &#8212; no graphics should go online without optimization. Vectors on the other hand often are tiny, but some older browsers won&#8217;t support it. Furthermore, if it&#8217;s lots of curves, it may be heavier than a bitmap, so select wisely.</span></p>
