<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>

So in today&#8217;s world everything is digitally available and Sales Funnel is a core concept of&nbsp;<strong>Digital Marketing</strong>. To be successful in this Digital world your business need to showcase the product and services you provide and how your business is unique, how you add value.</p>



<p>A sales funnel is a marketing concept that maps out the journey a customer goes through when making any kind of purchase. The model uses a funnel as an analogy because a large number of potential customers may begin at the top-end of the&nbsp;sales process, but only a fraction of these people actually end up making a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can Reach Right Audience for your Business?</h2>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sales Funnel is divided into multiple Steps</h2>



<p>Sales funnel is divided into multiple steps, which differ depending on the particular sales model. One of the most common ways of dividing a sales funnel possesses seven phases including:</p>



<p><strong>Awareness Phase</strong> Inn which prospects become aware of the existence of a solution.</p>



<p><strong>Interest Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects demonstrate interest in a product by conducting product research.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects or prospect companies examine competitors’ solutions as they inch toward a final buying decision.</p>



<p><strong>Decision Phase</strong>&nbsp;– In which a final decision is reached and negotiation begins.</p>



<p><strong>Purchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which goods or services are purchased.</p>



<p><strong>Reevaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in B2B sales it’s common for offerings to involve contracts that need to be renewed. As a customer becomes familiar with an offering, and especially as a contract draws to a close, a customer will enter a reevaluation phase during which they’ll decide whether or not to renew their contract.</p>



<p><strong>Repurchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which a customer repurchases a product or service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing each Stage of sales process</h2>



<p>Optimizing your website, facebook ads, sales funnel plays an important role to increase traffic, leads and Both marketing teams and inside sales managers commonly adopt strategies, tools, and tactics aimed at optimizing each stage of their sales process.  To reach out the audience you need right tools for it and a right Digital Marketing team who can help you out with this. </p>

<p>In today’s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Reading the ebullient reports, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives. And admittedly, it’s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so “there” you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we’re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.</span></a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All technologies come with risks</strong></h2>



<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it’s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It’s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don’t just enrich those who create them.</p>



<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robotics</span></a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/what-is-internet-of-things/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;– three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we rethink risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab</strong>, we’re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it’s the individuals, communities and organizations – the constituents – who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.</p>

<p>This language helps in making web pages <strong>interactive</strong> and <strong>dynamic </strong>which makes it essential addition among web applications. Nowadays, almost every website and <strong>web applications</strong> use JavaScript and almost every web browser has a dedicated JavaScript engine embedded in them. Though, initially intended for the purpose for improving web applications its vast properties were explored and then, later on, people recognised if we could embed it into host software then it could be used for many purposes server-side programming in web servers, databases, in word processors etc.</p>

<p><strong>DevOps&nbsp;</strong>is a new buzz in the world of IT. People interpret it as software but it is a&nbsp;<strong>concept</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>approach</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>methodology that combines software development and Information Technology to shorten the System Development Life Cycle.</strong></p>



<p>It is the offspring of agile software development, from the past few decades there is a need for a more holistic approach to the end to end Software Delivery Life-cycle. DevOps use the approach, practices and tools that increase an organization able to deliver Applications and Services at high velocity and throughput in comparison to the organization uses a traditional approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">chain of tools used commonly in<strong>&nbsp;DevOps environments</strong>.&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="991" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg" alt="What is DevOps" class="wp-image-5579" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-300x290.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-768x743.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1536x1486.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-696x673.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1068x1033.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-434x420.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Coding:&nbsp;</strong>Develop the code and review it, source code managing and merging tools.</p>



<p><strong>Building and Testing</strong>: These includes continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment tools with an emphasis on task automation. It also includes pre-deployment staging.</p>



<p><strong>Releasing:&nbsp;</strong>release approvals, release automation or deployment of software or applications</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring&nbsp;</strong>Other products to support DevOps include&nbsp;<strong>real-time monitoring</strong>&nbsp;and incident response systems, as well as collaboration platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes DevOps different from Agile?</strong></h2>



<p>So I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is DevOps?</strong>&nbsp;But what makes it different from previous methods like agile. The main difference is it works in real-time with more velocity that helps the development and operation team to get the updates and make changes efficiently according to customers and market needs which leads to<strong>&nbsp;Rapid Delivery</strong>&nbsp;of Products. Use practises like&nbsp;<strong>continuous integration</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>continuous delivery</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring and logging</strong>&nbsp;make this concept more &nbsp;<strong>reliable</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>scalable</strong>&nbsp;as is used for the cloud.

<p>In this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss</strong>. In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I’ve heard it all:</p>



<ul><li>“You can’t have privacy if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have security if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t get upgrades if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have a good user experience if you use Android!”</li><li>“YOU CAN’T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!”</li></ul>



<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;</em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I’m here to tell you they’re all equally misguided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now, don’t get me wrong:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a&nbsp;<em>nugget</em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we’re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don’t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don’t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).</p>



<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself — as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform — overlooks one key point. It’s a foundational reality of Android that’s been at the system’s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches</strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app’s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</strong></p>



<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner — that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;an “Android way” — not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.</p>



<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it’s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Same level of choice and control</strong></h2>



<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world’s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.</p>



<p>It’s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story — the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choice and control within Android</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll start with privacy — an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn’t actually that it’s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It’s simply that Google’s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don’t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it — at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.</p>



<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults — and most people aren’t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What’s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide</strong>; it’s just up to you to embrace it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>What about security? Well, it’s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources —&nbsp;<em>the horror!</em>&nbsp;— but, y’know, it’s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they’ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It’s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>That brings us to the realm of updates — both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It’s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion</strong></h2>



<p>The Pixel, as I’ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It’s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company’s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be — a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn’t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it’s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>to make. There’s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone’s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities — and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Android and iOS</strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates ’em. Neither platform’s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.</p>
