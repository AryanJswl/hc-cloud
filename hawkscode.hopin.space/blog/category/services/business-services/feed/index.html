<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>

<p>In this blog, I am going to talk about What is Sales Funnel and Sales Model? How you can boost your business, reach to right audience, Generate Leads and definately make profits. So in today&#8217;s world everything is digitally available and Sales Funnel is a core concept of&nbsp;<strong>Digital Marketing</strong>. To be successful in this Digital world your business need to showcase the product and services you provide and how your business is unique, how you add value.</p>



<p>A sales funnel is a marketing concept that maps out the journey a customer goes through when making any kind of purchase. The model uses a funnel as an analogy because a large number of potential customers may begin at the top-end of the&nbsp;sales process, but only a fraction of these people actually end up making a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can Reach Right Audience for your Business?</h2>



<p>Reaching a right audience is first step to generate business for this you have to be very specific with your niche. To help you out with this<strong> HawksCode Software Pvt Ltd </strong>is working as a Digital Marketing company<strong> </strong>from past 8 years. Successfully boost their client business.

<p>5. Grasshoper, Australia</p>



<p>6. Sunwave, New Zealand</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sales Funnel is divided into multiple Steps</h2>



<p>Sales funnel is divided into multiple steps, which differ depending on the particular sales model. One of the most common ways of dividing a sales funnel possesses seven phases including:</p>



<p><strong>Awareness Phase</strong> Inn which prospects become aware of the existence of a solution.</p>



<p><strong>Interest Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects demonstrate interest in a product by conducting product research.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects or prospect companies examine competitors’ solutions as they inch toward a final buying decision.</p>



<p><strong>Decision Phase</strong>&nbsp;– In which a final decision is reached and negotiation begins.</p>



<p><strong>Purchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which goods or services are purchased.</p>



<p><strong>Reevaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in B2B sales it’s common for offerings to involve contracts that need to be renewed. As a customer becomes familiar with an offering, and especially as a contract draws to a close, a customer will enter a reevaluation phase during which they’ll decide whether or not to renew their contract.</p>



<p><strong>Repurchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which a customer repurchases a product or service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing each Stage of sales process</h2>



<p>Optimizing your website, facebook ads, sales funnel plays an important role to increase traffic, leads and Both marketing teams and inside sales managers commonly adopt strategies, tools, and tactics aimed at optimizing each stage of their sales process.  To reach out the audience you need right tools for it and a right Digital Marketing team who can help you out with this. </p>

<p>In this blog, I am going to talk about the&nbsp;<strong>reasons why your business should use Podcasting.</strong>Podcasting has garnered an immense popularity over the years. A&nbsp;podcast&nbsp;is a set of digital audio files that are available on the internet for downloading. A user can subscribe to the podcast to receive the digital files once they are uploaded.</p>



<p>Businesses nowadays are increasingly using podcasts to improve their prospects. It is a powerful marketing tool. Podcasts have become the new talk radio on mobile devices. In fact, the increased usage of mobile phones has led to the explosive growth of podcasting.</p>



<p>“If you’re a business in an industry that has a high customer value, then a podcast may be one of your most effective education and marketing tools,” says Spencer Shaw, founder of the podcast production firm<strong>PodKick Media.</strong></p>



<p>More than one-third (39%) of owners of SMBs listen to podcasts, and 65% listen at least weekly,&nbsp;according to a survey by small business research firm Bredin. Listenership increases with company size, found that 70-72% of owners of businesses with 100 to 500 employees are tuning in.</p>



<p>You can’t demonstrate your credibility without sharing your expertise, and by sharing your expertise you become helpful. You become valuable for your listeners,” explains Stephen Woessner on his podcast&nbsp;Onward Nation, a daily podcast for business owners.</p>

<p><strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.&nbsp;</strong>Network troubleshooting tools are a necessity for every network administrator. When getting started in the networking field, it is important to amass a number of tools that can be used to troubleshoot a variety of different network conditions.</p>



<p>While it is true that the the use of specific tools can be subjective and at the discretion of the engineer, the selection of tools in this article has been made based on their generality and common use. </p>



<p>Following are the <strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ping</strong></h2>



<p>The most commonly used network tool is the ping utility. This utility is used to provide a basic connectivity test between the requesting host and a destination host. This is done by using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) which has the ability to send an echo packet to a destination host and a mechanism to listen for a response from this host. Simply stated, if the requesting host receives a response from the destination host, this host is reachable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracert/traceroute</strong></h2>



<p>Typically, once the ping utility has been used to determine basic connectivity, the tracert/traceroute utility can used to determine more specific information about the path to the destination host including the route the packet takes and the response time of these intermediate hosts. The tracert utility and traceroute utilities perform the same function but operate on different operating systems, Tracert for Windows machines and traceroute for Linux/*nix based machines.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ipconfig/ifconfig</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most important things that must be completed when troubleshooting a networking issue is to find out the specific IP configuration of the variously affected hosts. Sometimes this information is already known when addressing is configured statically, but when a dynamic addressing method is used, the IP address of each host can potentially change often.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nslookup</strong></h2>



<p>networking issues revolve around issues with Dynamic Name System (DNS) address resolution issues. DNS is used by everyone using the Internet to resolve commonly known domain names (i.e. google.com) to commonly unknown IP addresses (i.e. 74.125.115.147). When this system does not work, most of the functionality that people are used to goes away, as there is no way to resolve this information. The nslookup utility can be used to lookup the specific IP address(es) associated with a domain name. If this utility is unable to resolve this information, there is a DNS issue. Along with simple lookup, the nslookup utility is able to query specific DNS servers to determine an issue with the default DNS servers configured on a host.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DNS Lookup</strong></h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>DNS Lookup</strong>&nbsp;tool retrieves domain name records for the domain name that you provide. You can use this to help diagnose problems and see if the problem originates from the domain name server — if you cannot return a domain’s records, you’ll know where to begin troubleshooting!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;allows you to test the validity and reachability of an email address. It makes sure that the email is syntactically valid and that it is available via an SMTP server. If you’re trying to cull false email addresses from your email list or something similar, this tool will be helpful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTTP Headers</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5712" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The HTTP Headers tool allows you to see what headers are returned by a web server for a specific domain name or IP Address. If you notice odd behavior with your HTTP connections, you can use this tool to troubleshoot the top-level domain. Alternatively, you can use it to check for redirection — minimizing these optimizes any links you might be using.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>URL Encode Decode</strong></h2>



<p>If you need to include special characters in your URL, you’ll need to encode them so that the URL remains valid. You can do this with&nbsp;<strong>URL Encode</strong>. Conversely, if a URL contains special characters and has been encoded, yet you want to see it in a more human-readable form, use&nbsp;<strong>URL Decode</strong>&nbsp;to standardize the URL.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WHO IS  Search</strong></h2>



<p>If you are curious as to who the responsible party (or parties) is behind a domain name, the <strong>WHOIS query</strong> will allow you to query multiple domain registrars’ databases. If the owner has chosen to hide their information, you can nevertheless return forwarding information.</p>

To have a chance of competing for a piece of the pie, finance websites must incorporate the design that encourages visitors to turn into customers as effectively as possible. Each potential visitor could be worth thousands of dollars depending on the financial product being offered.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The finance market is huge, but so is the competition.

When comparing to retail or e-commerce which averages 3%, is very good, especially when considering the value of each paying finance customer.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it is possible to increase this rate as some top online financial companies enjoy conversion rate of 15% and more. If you want to be among such companies as well then you have landed on the right page.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Given below are five value tips on how to convert your visitors into buyers.</span></span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>1. Work on the Layout and Presentation</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Make sure to keep your website layout simple and easy navigate so visitors ‘know what you do’ and can quickly find what they need. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Financial sites should be clutter free and not use a lot of colors. Simple colors, such as white and light shades of blue, </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">can do the trick. Below is a great example of a small business loans website operated by </span></span><a href="https://www.unsecuredbusinessloans.com.au/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">www.unsecuredbusinessloans.com.au</span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">. They use white space effectively and provide clear messaging to get their point across of who they are, what they do and how to get started. </span></span></p>

<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>2. Make Sure to Provide All Information</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Provide visitors with all the information they might need so that they have no reason to go to another website.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, the right information depends on a number of factors, most importantly as a financial services business in Australia you must display your </span></span><a href="https://asic.gov.au/for-finance-professionals/afs-licensees/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>Australian Financial Services Licence</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> (AFSL).</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">If your business offers home loans, you should provide all details on the website such as loan amount, repayment time, interest rates and any fees for acquiring the loan.</span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>3. Give Importance to the Call For Action</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You have to tell visitors what to do so that they can do it. For example, if you want them to hire your consultancy services, push them to do so by having a call to action button on your page, which should be strategically placed.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The button should ideally be on the top of the page or at the bottom so that it is easily visible to your visitors. Moreover, it should be readable and attractive. You can also use other effective CTA methods. See what works the best for you.</span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>4. Add Authenticity and Let Customers Reach You</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Add some authenticity to your site by providing details such as your company history, physical address and contact number. This would help users have more faith in your company, which is very important in this job. Why would anyone want to deal with a company that they do not trust?</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">You should be available to answer all questions over calls, emails and also live chat, which is said to be the most effective method when it comes to getting in touch with your customers.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Live chat is affordable and offers great ROI as well. Moreover, you can also add an FAQ section to your site and cover all questions related to your business so that users have no problem in finding what they need.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5233" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-3.png" alt="" width="525" height="350" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-3.png 525w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/PR-3-300x200.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>5. Make Your Site Safe and Secure</b></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Security is of huge importance especially when it comes to financial matters. Hacking is a big challenge that almost all businesses have to face. Visitors would not be interested in working with you if your website appears shady or unsafe.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There are a number of things you can do to make things right. Firstly, follow security protocols and make sure to keep your site updated at all times.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition to this, make use of a reliable and trusted payment gateway like </span></span><a href="https://www.paypal.com/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>PayPal</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> and </span></span><a href="https://www.2checkout.com/"><span style="color: #1155cc;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>2Checkout</u></span></span></span></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">. Such options are well known in the industry and can convince people to put in their personal details such as credit card information without any worries.</span></span></p>

It is a way to convert your traffic into a potential customer. From a client’s perspective, it&#8217;s a place to look for a job. Know your niche it will help you to get the right gigs.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the previous article, we had discussions on the proposal, how it become attract clients for our organization. Now we will move further on job boards, which is another way to attract the client. Response to proposal gives us good contracts and new project opportunities. But they’re time exhaustive and time is very essential for our business. It is more important when you want to improve your revenue by getting multiple new clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this situation, you might prefer a third-party marketplace.  These platforms allow freelancers to bid on them and also has a list of potential client’s. This is a better option because here web developers can post their hourly rate and for a specific project type, they can be hired by clients.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are different kind of platforms which provide these facilities. Have a look at these following platforms.</p>
<h1><strong>Platforms to use Job Boards</strong></h1>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="color: #111111; font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 27px;">Upwork</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upwork – work with someone perfect for your team</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></span></em> is a popular marketplace platform, previously known as Odesk where you can collaborate and connect with your business and individual professionals. It gives the option to place the bids on client projects. It will not allow posting your own services. Upwork is a great place for your business to find new and recurring clients. In simple terms, we can say it is a cost-effective and simple way for clients to hire, work with and pay freelancers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now we will take a short discussion about how to attract clients on upwork. For this, you should focus on your profile, which works like pull for clients instead of push. Mention these three points in your profile which will make it attractive.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>Define your Ideal Client with a narrow niche tends to your work.</li>
<li>Defines the problems that they face with respect to your niche.</li>
<li>What result you will give them, define it.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don’t make a profile which is about who you are. A client will never pay for you, they will pay for this how you can solve their problems. So prepare a profile which is about clients problems, how you will solve those problems and give the result as they want.</p>
<h2><strong> Freelancer</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://www.freelancer.com/">Freelancer</a></span></em> is similar to upwork which allows you to browse your relevant work and bid on projects. It provides two ways of services: projects and contests. The project allows placing bods on jobs whereas contests allow submitting a work with a payment amount.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To attract a client on freelancer you should follow three things to do.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>When a client post a project place the bid within an hour. Clients need a project filled fast because a bunch of generic Spam replies.</li>
<li>Test your profile, it will cost you money which is more than creative proposals.</li>
<li>Stay online when you apply for a project because clients may chat immediately with applicants. Active users also appear higher in search because they may choose someone else if you are not online.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong> PeoplePerHour</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em><a href="https://www.peopleperhour.com/"><span style="color: #000000;">PeoplePerHour</span></a></em> is a UK based company which allow posting a job for how much per hour they’d charge to do it. It is a marketplace which is used to connect freelancers and small businesses to buy and sell their services all over the world.</p>

We know how big this name is and it has its foot in many regions like job guide, music, AI, US Department of Defense and many things. Now, this giant is planning to come into Indian ecommerce market. In India the ecommerce battle is already tensed enough with Flipkart, Amazon, eBay and other too. But now adding a new member may make it more intense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a report, <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/project-maven-google-ended-contract-pentagon-dod/" target="_blank">Google</a></span></strong></span> might come into the Indian market in this years ending. This launch might happen at end of the year or near Diwali. But a Google executive is seeing these reports as some speculation. In recent time Google has invested in JD.com, a Chinese ecommerce firm. The investment was of about $500M. Both companies are stating this deal just as a strategic partnership. Both have given statement about developing the market. Few time ago Walmart and JD.com have also gone under the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caesar Sengupta, Leads product management in Google HQ, is testing India market. They want to be sure before making their appearance in the market. If everything goes as per their plan than India will be Google’s first customer in ecommerce business. Google is confident of huge benefits from its 18M email users and other subscribers. This big audience will help in purchasing power and choice of million users online.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Indian government’s <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Economic Survey 2018</strong></span> revealed that India’s ecommerce <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>market reached $33B</strong></span> registering a <strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;">19.1% growth in 2016-2017</span></strong>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, there are some words like Google is going to make an investment of $1-2B into Flipkart via Walmart. Walmart has acquired 77% of Flipkart’s stacks with investing $16B. This big takeover of stacks are still being considered but the move played by Google is not much of a surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we go back to 2012, Google launched its Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF). This shopping event made its appearance in December 2012. This festival was discontinued in November 2015 due to growing ecommerce websites Flipkart and Amazon. GOSF was kind of foundation for the ecommerce players like Flipkart, Myntra and Snapdeal and other. With its advertising, Google is encouraging brick and mortar seller to get listed on Google. Google is extracting data from its different channel to come solid into the market at this time. Hope, we will see them sooner in the market.</p>
