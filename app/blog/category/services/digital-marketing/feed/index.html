<p><strong>Reevaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in B2B sales it’s common for offerings to involve contracts that need to be renewed.

These details include the text and some of the dangling threads of information used to program your site.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Great amounts of research have been conducted to determine what these factors are and to what extent Google places value on each element. The results are ultimately educated guesses at best.  Google tells the world very little about how it ranks websites, at least not directly.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Does Google Ranking Work in 2019?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google uses a variety of factors in its algorithm to determine what results will be the most helpful for the user. It also uses latent semantic indexing, which uses search intent as an indicator of what results are the most relevant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google built its current algorithm around RankBrain, a machine learning (AI) algorithm Google uses to help sort and improve the search results. Backlinko condensed it pretty well:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">In short, RankBrain tweaks the algorithm on its own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Depending on the keyword, RankBrain will increase or decrease the importance of backlinks, content freshness, content length, domain authority, etc. Then, it looks at how Google searchers interact with new search results. If users like the new algorithm better, it stays. If not, RankBrain rolls back the old algorithm.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The reason for this is because one search term can have hundreds of meanings. For example, if I conduct a search for the word “bathroom,” Google has no idea of what I’m really looking for. Possible results could range wildly, including:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Finding the nearest public restroom</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Defining what a bathroom is</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Emergency Plumbing</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Bathroom remodeling companies</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">News stories</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Home decor websites</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Cleaning advice</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bad design will hurt your SEO</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Someone goes online and searches for an answer, a service, or a product, and it leads them to your website. Sweet!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>…But</strong> <strong>suppose</strong> they choose not to engage with your content because of poor design. It’s too hard to read, too ugly, too complicated. They’ll return to the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) to find a better answer to their query.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop-ups:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Pop-ups can be useful, but serve as a pain point for your online audience, especially if they haven’t accessed any of your content yet. Use them sparingly, and not as soon as someone arrives at your site. Generally, you need to build trust with your audience before making an ask for their contact information or a commitment like subscription sign up.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illegible text:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you’ve chosen a font that is too small, too hard to read, or is presented as part of an offensive color scheme, people will not stick around to decipher your messaging. Using a readability tool will help you ensure that your text is always a delight for your visitors to read.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loud sounds:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;">You should never make audio tracks or video play automatically on your website. If you do have a clip playing automatically, ensure that it&#8217;s muted.</span></p>

With the debut of new tendencies in email marketing such as gamification, hyper-personalization, typography, machine learning, etc. marketers produce new strategies for their email campaigns. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you own a business, then you need to think about running email marketing </span>campaigns<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> and incorporate the recent tendencies. However, before that, here are the most crucial steps which have to be followed to make the most of your email marketing strategy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Email marketing is an effective digital strategy, particularly for companies with limited marketing resources, because it delivers the highest return on investment (ROI). For each dollar that you invest, you can generate $44 &#8212; that&#8217;s 4400 percent in ROI! </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Let us take a peek at how you can market your emails. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Build your Email List</b></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">No matter how great or high-quality your </span>emails<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">, if nobody opens them it is a waste of time and energy. Although it may be tempting to get or mine email addresses to rapidly get an initial subscriber database, do not do it! Not only is it unethical, but folks don&#8217;t enjoy receiving emails that they didn&#8217;t opt into, and you can drive potential customers away from your brand. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">It&#8217;s time to build your email list so that you may begin sending campaigns which those goals. There are a couple of different methods by which you can build your email list. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Import a List of Known Contacts</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you&#8217;re planning on using email to stay in contact with existing customers, then your email list could be built largely by importing your existing client&#8217;s details into your preferred email marketing tool. For Campaign Monitor clients, you may either manually upload </span>an present<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> list or you can join your own Campaign Monitor account to the tool wherever your client data resides and automatically sync your client information into your Campaign Monitor account. Before you export any contacts though, make certain you have sufficient permission to email these readers. </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Create Your List from Scratch</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Fortunately for you, there is a 2-part formulation for building your email list that&#8217;s followed by many of the very prosperous email marketers </span>around<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">. The formula is: </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">How many subscribe chances you present to some visitor, it&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;ll act with no valuable incentive. And however great your incentive is, you still will need to make it simple for people to subscribe if you would like to make them join your listing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The actual question is, what makes for a wonderful incentive? And how can you make subscribing to your record really straightforward and effortless? </span></p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Compelling content </b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should you&#8217;ve got a blog or create content on your site, then offering to deliver your best content to subscribers via email is a powerful incentive for them to join your listing.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>First order reductions </b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Should you sell products through an online shop, then offering people a discount on their first order if they subscribe to your email list is a wonderful incentive. Not only does it encourage people to register, but gives them an incentive to purchase too.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Free or express shipping upgrade </b></span></h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Offering free or upgraded shipping on your clients&#8217; buy is a great incentive to join your list. Not merely is this deal highly relevant &#8212; especially when offered throughout the checkout procedure &#8212; but having the ability to receive a desirable thing in their hands faster is a potent incentive for individuals to subscribe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Furthermore, the other portion of the equation is offering numerous, simple subscribe opportunities as this makes it effortless for folks to opt-in. While the type of subscribe kind you use will depend on the incentive You&#8217;re offering </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The key to any fantastic list building script, online or in person, is answering four key questions most potential readers will possess </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><b>First</b>, what is in it for them? Describe the value of joining your email list. This may consist of exclusive discounts and promotions, useful content, or invitations to events. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><b>Secondly</b>, exactly what transpired do they have? Address any possible concerns such as the frequency you are going to be sending </span>emails<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">, and also how easy it&#8217;s going to be for them to unsubscribe. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Make it painless and foolproof. Guide them through the signup process, doing it to them whenever possible. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Eventually, what if they expect next? Describe what happens next and which sort of </span>emails<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> they could expect to get. </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Email Marketing Strategy and Tactics</b></span></h2>

However, how to do this test procedure efficiently?</p>

If the visitor does not see what they want when they land on your website, they will immediately depart and find another ecommerce website better suited to their needs. The benefit being, when you enter a global market, the chances of whom it&#8217;s possible to target are immense. Market research and also an ecommerce localization partner will make the task simpler.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span>Here&#8217;s a comprehensive guide Which You Can often refer for optimizing your digital marketing strategies:<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Digital Marketing Tips to for your eCommerce Business</strong></h2>
<h3><b> Set Your customer first</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For many businesses, particularly those from the midmarket with restricted resources, individual employees wear a number of hats. Take that into account if these multitaskers will be the target customers. Your clients&#8217; opinions are more important than your own when it comes to shaping the facts of your offering. Bring them in from Day 0 and make their views part of their founding principles.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;re looking for the team members that will be charged with attracting new clients and closing deals for your organization, investigate people who were selling to an identical target market in past positions, and then use those former clients as the first references you call. Discover what these hiring prospects did right and what they did wrong, and decide how they could fit into your lineup. Your future customers will appreciate that early effort to think about their viewpoints when they are dealing with your well-qualified sales staff down the road.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As an entrepreneur, you&#8217;ll end up getting pulled in different directions throughout the afternoon, and there are particular areas where it is crucial to delegate responsibility. However, establishing the correct company dynamic in regards to customer experience is an initiative you can never afford to fail.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Provide real-time personalized encounter</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Consumers are concerned with their information but they do prefer reputable online retailers to offer a customized shopping experience. The latest GDPR legislation insists on supplying customers the flexibility to control the use of their private information through new sites. You should have an opt-in and opt-out criterion while providing personalized supplies to clients who&#8217;opt-in&#8217;. Showcase products they favor and those that are lying within their wishlist and invite them to buy. In any case, don&#8217;t infringe their privacy.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Create innovative email marketing campaigns</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Influencing clients by sending regular emails on your trending products or present offers can be effectively done using personalized emails. Possessing a solid email network and segment the customers so that you are able to provide equal focus on different kinds of customers. Make certain to check subscriber activity, send monthly newsletters and gentle reminders about the items left in their own cart.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Upsell products that your clients may show prospective attention without hitting their inboxes also frequently. Employ A/B testing in the checkout process to understand why customers leave the store without buying. You can even automate these processes with eCommerce revenue generation tools like TargetBay.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Create your E-commerce website mobile friendly</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Kissmetrics: If an e-commerce site is making $100,000 per day, a 1-second page postpone could potentially cost you $2.5 million in lost sales every year. This means a delay in webpage reaction of one second may cause a 7 percent decrease in conversions. Offering an excellent product or service is not enough to drive conversion. When it comes to retaining customers and making sales, you cannot treat everybody the exact same anymore. As a retailer, give them a personalized buying experience on mobile.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The inquiry, after developing a cellular responsive site is: Why does your site convert prospects and visitors into clients?<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">How frequently have we come across cellular responsive sites littered with text and images? Finding the CTA on the e-commerce website becomes a battle! To prevent such a frustrating experience for the visitor, place yourself in their shoes. Make the content easily readable on the mobile. Use the information gathered to make a personalized and real-time omnichannel experience for your customers across stations, locations, and apparatus.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Utilize Opt-In Pop-Up Give to Drive Them over the Edge</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to enhance your conversion rates and earnings, do not overlook the potential of opt-in offers. This not only increases your contacts (a helpful resource for email marketing) considerably but also boosts sales quickly.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A pop-up on a potential client&#8217;s display who is on the fence about purchasing from your website may well be influenced by a well-placed opt-in offer. For example, 10 percent off on their initial purchase or free shipping above $499. Even though they might not complete the transaction at that moment, they will likely subscribe to your opt-in offer, so they still got added to a database and they may change their mind and return to finish the sale.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Be certain that you test every part of an online offer for maximum optimization. Often A/B tests different offers to see which one works best for fetching more sign-ups. Make sure that people see the pop-ups before they are about to leave the page. Bear in mind, the more people who input their email addresses at opt-in, the higher the probability is that they will earn a future sale.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Use social media efficiently with SMO techniques</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest may be used for showcasing your articles banners while Twitter may be used to send regular updates and conducting competitions to engage the viewers. In general, your social networking presence may bring some of their best customers and provide an opportunity to allow them to immediately interact with your brand.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Create an e-commerce site with Fantastic articles</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;d notice closely you would see that the trend is fast changing. Earlier people would create e-commerce websites with the latest technologies, programs and all sorts of elements.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But now technology was substituted by emotions. You will see the e-commerce sites which don&#8217;t use the high-end technology but rather spend on content. Their content is simple, comprehensible jargon-free and emotionally prized.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The content is really the king. So, try to go for a jargon-free content which informs about you and your company&#8217;s character, ethical values and a most important journey in place of the products you sell or services you supply. You are able to include those components in the menu hyperlinks supplied instead of boring your audience with the home page.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Optimize SEO with proven techniques</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Assess the site architecture to ensure every website page is visible to the public and it can be discovered by search engines without any blocks. Figure out the very best performing keywords that drive earnings and allocate them to the particular web pages so as to enhance their rank. Optimize the content strategy to engage viewers that will drive more traffic and increase conversions. Utilize research tools to link your content pages with authoritative sites. Review the search engine optimization process regularly and make positive improvements.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<h3><b> Collect client feedback and reviews</b></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People rely on client feedback over the brand and other resources. Based on Invesp, online reviews have up to 90% taste and 88% hope online reviews that includes a personal recommendation as well. Positive reviews help build trust while unwanted testimonials give an opportunity to improvise on the weak points. Be certain that you have a notable section in every item page which lists consumer reviews and evaluations.<span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital advertising is an evolving process and it requires time and expertise to figure out the most optimized strategy. While we have addressed the most fundamental parameters here, you can go out and experiment with new strategies that are most appropriate for your brand. Successfully conducting an e-commerce company is never a sure bet, but using the above-mentioned approaches will ensure that you haven&#8217;t left things merely to opportunity. Moreover, each one of these strategies will work if executed correctly!<a href="https://diggitymarketing.com/category/seo-news/"><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}"> <span style="color: #000080;">More information.</span></span></a></p>

It is also perceived as an endorsement of the brand by many potential buyers. And a large percentage of people trust influencers and online reviews as much as they would trust a friend&#8217;s advice.” says David Abehsera, President and Co-founder of The Woo.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5110" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg" alt="Google, Trends, SEO, Data, Work" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg 1280w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>Before 2006, we were unable to know what people are interested in or if something big has happened. Google Trends is world’s largest real time search data set. On this tool, one can have access to what people are searching in different regions of the world. Every year trillions of the search query are generated and Google keeps storing and analyzing the data. So if anything big happened you can interpret the news with Google Trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might look similar to the Google Keyword Planner but what it shows is a popularity over the time. There is a big difference here when it comes to long-term trending keywords and short term. If you are writing blogs that trend for a while go for keywords those are trending in present time. But if you are planning to keep your web page trending then go for long term keywords.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>What is Google Trends Data?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The data that Google trends have is an unbiased data that is searched by billions of people from around the world. This data categorized, do not identify persons and well arranged. This allows Trend user to go with searches those are trending from worldwide to city-geography. You can manually make search too of your favorite topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is two way of time zone filter. One is Real time Filter. Real time filter picks the data for query form last 7 days. On the other hand, there is Non-real time filter. This can go back to 2004 or ~36 hours back. The query can be random or whatever you like to search. Both can’t be viewed together. Both have a different set of queries that lies in a different set of time zone.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How to Work with Trends?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we said earlier, Trends and Keyword Planner both show different data and both have different meanings. Now if you combine the data of Trends and Keyword planner you will get a better understanding of your keywords. With the help of Trends, you will know what will your potential future market. It also saves your business trip expenses for the business. Trends will let you know how trending your services are in particular country or region. So before making the trip, cross check the data with trends.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How Trends works for SEO?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Google Trends doesn’t give actual search numbers, it works best when used in combination with the Keyword Planner. Google Trends will show a “normalized” or relative level of interest over time for a prospective keyword phrase. It also allows you to compare the level of interest among potential target phrases. It also breakdowns the geo tagging by the ‘search by region’. Also, it is a big help in regional or local SEO. When it comes to content writing trends let you know what people are interested in. So grab the combine it with some keywords and your post is going to flourish with great traffic and top rank.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Digital_Marketing.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5096" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Digital_Marketing.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing, Business, Email Marketing, Brand Building" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Digital_Marketing.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Digital_Marketing-300x176.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Digital_Marketing-696x408.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Digital_Marketing-717x420.jpg 717w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a>Every business needs exposure and in this jet speed time, everything needs to be done at fast pace. From information to cash everything is getting digital and marketing in not untouched with that. Marketing is now moved from paper and door to door to digital screens. There are several strategies one can adapt to use digital marketing but why is it better? Or is it that much effective? Then we can say, you need door to door as well as digital advertisement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing here is that instead of traditional <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ff9900;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/digital-marketing/" target="_blank">marketing</a></span></strong></span>. It has more audience and can target larger and particular audience too. This advertising strategy has a motto of making the bigger presence of your brand. It is about making your existence for Internet gods like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. That will spread your name far than traditional advertising reach. So what it offers to your business.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>E-mail Marketing:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/email_marketing.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5097" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/email_marketing.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing, Business, Email Marketing, Brand Building" width="800" height="350" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/email_marketing.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/email_marketing-300x131.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/email_marketing-696x305.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>One of the best strategies in digital marketing. It only targets the audience that is concerned with your business. In this strategy, your business will send emails to the clients who are willing or already interested in your service. In this, you can pick your target from the traffic coming on your website. As they give you their e-mail then contact them through email service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sent them an email containing all the information of your services and offers you have for them. Make offers as per their interests and what they want from you. This strategy kills the time wasted in targeting uninterested audience. It works as a filter strategy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Lead Generation:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lead_Generation.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5098" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lead_Generation.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing, Business, Email Marketing, Brand Building" width="800" height="350" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lead_Generation.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lead_Generation-300x131.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lead_Generation-696x305.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>The main strategy that brings new people to your business website every single day. Some may be old too. If there is old one then it is good news that means they are interested in your service. Now, this way a new coming customer may not be interested but someone they knew might be. Or someday they will be. So this way you can spread your name to more and more people.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Creating Awareness:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Creating_Awareness.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5095" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Creating_Awareness.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing, Business, Email Marketing, Brand Building" width="800" height="350" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Creating_Awareness.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Creating_Awareness-300x131.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Creating_Awareness-696x305.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Let’s understand it with an example. John wants to buy cloth so he started searching for it online. He found your product on Amazon or your website. But he knows that your offline store is nearby where he lives. So instead of buying it online he will go to the store and will buy that product. No one wants to wait for 2 to 3 days to get what they want. So by this method, it increases your off-sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also if you do not sell products offline then also there is no big issue. Digital marketing knows how to bring customers on your online portals or websites. But you need to know that digital marketing team will only bring traffic to your website or product. That traffic can be turned into a client by two ways. Either your business team will interact with them or another solution is content. An influencing content, written for business purpose will make them use your services so you are going to need a good team on content that know about marketing and advertisement.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Brand Building:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brand_Building.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5094" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brand_Building.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing, Business, Email Marketing, Brand Building" width="800" height="350" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brand_Building.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brand_Building-300x131.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Brand_Building-696x305.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Brand building is thing that it will do while doing all these tasks. SEO and SMO are the strategies those are used for this purpose. Now a day every brand has mobile app. In this era of digitization people need things easy to access. No one wants to type URL and open hectic browsers. Things are moving on to application now and your business need to move too.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Mobile apps are so easy and it produces stable and potential customers. People in free time uses mobile and sometime they open apps they usually not use daily. So if you are providing shopping materials, foods, fun content or other things, they will visit you once in a week. If they find app attractive and content interesting then they will keep it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Social Media and Mobile Apps:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social_Media_App.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5099" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social_Media_App.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing, Business, Email Marketing, Brand Building" width="800" height="350" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social_Media_App.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social_Media_App-300x131.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Social_Media_App-696x305.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Some they just keep the app install and forget about it. But you can take help of social media to engage them again with the app. Collaborate your advertisement on the social media apps. They will show them your ad in between their app usage time. Now these ads will help you in marketing and spreading the brand name. This brings instantaneity in sale and user number.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Social-Media.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4818" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Social-Media.png" alt="Social Media" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Social-Media.png 960w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Social-Media-300x169.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Social-Media-696x392.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Social-Media-747x420.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When anyone talks about social media reach, Facebook is the first name that came to mind. Facebook is always the centre of these kind of conversations. Also, it is one that came to mind when we talk about organic traffic. Organic reach of the Facebook is always center of topic whenever people talk about SMO. There are some theories that it is all because of money. Facebook wants you to invest in their campaign to increase reach. But the thing is it is not all about money.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are many discussion regarding this on the Internet. One that pulled our interest was a post of Brian Christiano. <span style="background-color: #ff0f93; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/future-danger-of-facebook-personal-data/" target="_blank">Everyone was questioning Fb</a></strong></span> for its organic traffic declining with time. The original question was:</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>“</strong><span class="td_text_highlight_marker_blue td_text_highlight_marker" style="color: #00a6ed;"><strong><span style="color: #ffffff;">Why is non-paid</span> <span style="background-color: #0077d9; color: #ffffff;">Facebook</span> <span style="color: #ffffff;">reach so bad?</span></strong></span></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span class="td_text_highlight_marker_yellow td_text_highlight_marker" style="color: #0060de;">It seems like a pay to win on <strong>Facebook</strong>, just wondered why it was so bad.</span><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>”</strong></span></h2>
<p style="clear: both; text-align: justify;">Brian explained this in very well manner on why the organic traffic is so bad. He said partially you can say that Facebook is into money now. But not fully, there is a thing called News Feed Algorithm. Facebook has adapted Google feed algo for their news feed.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what does that mean? Should we make our post optimized? The answer is NO. Zuckerburg has already cleared about this that he wants to keep Facebook engaging. They want to show only engaging content to their users. So how this algo decide which post is engaging? Then answer is that when one page makes a post, Fb puts it into a small pool of page’s followers. They analyze the engagement rate in that small group of people. If it falls above their preset value it goes to other followers too else get declined.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That small pool is only 2-5% of your current followers. So smaller your follower in number then it will become harder to get engaged with all your audience.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The one thing that brands don&#8217;t take into account is that the algorithm is rolling. So if your brand has posted poor content for a while and all of a sudden posts something theoretically awesome then FB knows historically your content sucks and it won&#8217;t widen the audience. This is why brands can cause so much damage to themselves by posting garbage or too much promotional nonsense. It hurts short term and long term.” &#8211; Brian Christiano.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So we can not basically blame Facebook alone here. They are also trying to keep up their quality just like us. Facebook is proving that they are best in social media and actually they are. Fb holds one of the best social media campaign and audience than other media.</p>
