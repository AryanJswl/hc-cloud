<p><strong>Amazon Web Services Management Console&nbsp;</strong>is a&nbsp;<strong>web application</strong>&nbsp;that comprises and refers to a broad collection of service consoles for managing&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazon-web-services-and-their-products/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Amazon Web Services</span></strong></a>. When you first sign in, you see the console home page. Discover new services, manage your entire account, build new applications, and learn how to do even more with AWS.&nbsp;The console makes it easy to find new AWS services, configure services, view service usage, and so much more. From updating user groups to building applications to troubleshooting issues, with the Console, you can take action quickly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Secure login and sessions</strong></h2>



<p>The AWS Management Console gives you secure login using your<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazon-web-services-and-their-products/" target="_blank"><strong>&nbsp;<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">AWS</span></strong>&nbsp;</a>or IAM account credentials. For added security, your login session automatically expires after 12 hours. To resume your session, simply click the “Click login to continue” button and log in again. You can also set your own time limits on federated sessions, based on your organization’s preference, using the federation API (GetFederationToken or AssumeRole).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Browser support</strong></h2>



<p>Explore any AWS service with your choice of browsers. The Console supports the three latest versions of&nbsp;<strong>Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari</strong>&nbsp;as well as<strong>&nbsp;Microsoft Internet Explorer 11</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Mobile app</strong></h2>



<p>The&nbsp;AWS Console mobile app&nbsp;lets you easily view your existing resources, including CloudWatch alarms, and perform operational tasks from your iOS or Android mobile device. Download the mobile app from&nbsp;<strong>Amazon Appstore</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;Google Play</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>iTunes</strong>.</p>



<p>Getting Started with&nbsp;<strong>AWS Management Console</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>AWS Management Console&nbsp;</strong>provides multiple ways for navigating to individual service consoles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To open a console for a service</strong></h2>



<p>Do one of the following:</p>



<ul><li>Enter the name of the service in the search box. Then choose the service that you want from the list of search results.</li><li>Choose one of your recently visited services under the search box.</li><li>Choose&nbsp;<strong>Services</strong>&nbsp;to open a full list of services. On the upper right of the page, choose&nbsp;<strong>Group</strong>&nbsp;to see the services listed by category or choose&nbsp;<strong>A–Z</strong>&nbsp;to see an alphabetical listing. Then choose the service that you want.</li></ul>

<p><strong>DevOps&nbsp;</strong>is a new buzz in the world of IT. People interpret it as software but it is a&nbsp;<strong>concept</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>approach</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>methodology that combines software development and Information Technology to shorten the System Development Life Cycle.</strong></p>



<p>It is the offspring of agile software development, from the past few decades there is a need for a more holistic approach to the end to end Software Delivery Life-cycle. DevOps use the approach, practices and tools that increase an organization able to deliver Applications and Services at high velocity and throughput in comparison to the organization uses a traditional approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">chain of tools used commonly in<strong>&nbsp;DevOps environments</strong>.&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="991" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg" alt="What is DevOps" class="wp-image-5579" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-300x290.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-768x743.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1536x1486.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-696x673.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1068x1033.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-434x420.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Coding:&nbsp;</strong>Develop the code and review it, source code managing and merging tools.</p>



<p><strong>Building and Testing</strong>: These includes continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment tools with an emphasis on task automation. It also includes pre-deployment staging.</p>



<p><strong>Releasing:&nbsp;</strong>release approvals, release automation or deployment of software or applications</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring&nbsp;</strong>Other products to support DevOps include&nbsp;<strong>real-time monitoring</strong>&nbsp;and incident response systems, as well as collaboration platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes DevOps different from Agile?</strong></h2>



<p>So I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is DevOps?</strong>&nbsp;But what makes it different from previous methods like agile. The main difference is it works in real-time with more velocity that helps the development and operation team to get the updates and make changes efficiently according to customers and market needs which leads to<strong>&nbsp;Rapid Delivery</strong>&nbsp;of Products. Use practises like&nbsp;<strong>continuous integration</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>continuous delivery</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring and logging</strong>&nbsp;make this concept more &nbsp;<strong>reliable</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>scalable</strong>&nbsp;as is used for the cloud. Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>&nbsp;by using&nbsp;<strong>automated compliance policies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>fine-grained controls</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>configuration management</strong>&nbsp;techniques.</p>

<p>In this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss</strong>. In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I’ve heard it all:</p>



<ul><li>“You can’t have privacy if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have security if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t get upgrades if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have a good user experience if you use Android!”</li><li>“YOU CAN’T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!”</li></ul>



<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;</em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I’m here to tell you they’re all equally misguided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now, don’t get me wrong:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a&nbsp;<em>nugget</em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we’re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don’t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don’t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).</p>



<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself — as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform — overlooks one key point. It’s a foundational reality of Android that’s been at the system’s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches</strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app’s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</strong></p>



<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner — that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;an “Android way” — not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.</p>



<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it’s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Same level of choice and control</strong></h2>



<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world’s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.</p>



<p>It’s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story — the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choice and control within Android</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll start with privacy — an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn’t actually that it’s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It’s simply that Google’s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don’t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it — at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.</p>



<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults — and most people aren’t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What’s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide</strong>; it’s just up to you to embrace it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>What about security? Well, it’s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources —&nbsp;<em>the horror!</em>&nbsp;— but, y’know, it’s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they’ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It’s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>That brings us to the realm of updates — both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It’s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion</strong></h2>



<p>The Pixel, as I’ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It’s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company’s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be — a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn’t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it’s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>to make. There’s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone’s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities — and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Android and iOS</strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates ’em. Neither platform’s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.</p>

<p><strong>What is State in React?</strong>&nbsp;<em>State</em>&nbsp;is a JavaScript object that stores component’s dynamic data and it enables a component to keep track of changes between renders. Because state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity so you don’t use it for static React projects.</p>



<p>Components defined as classes have some additional features. Local&nbsp;<em>state</em>&nbsp;is exactly that: a feature available only to classes. S<em>tate</em>&nbsp;can only be used within a class and usually the only place where you can assign&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;is the constructor.</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br><strong>constructor()&nbsp;</strong>{<br><strong>super()</strong>;<strong>this</strong>.state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br>state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<h2 class="has-very-dark-gray-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>State Updates May Be Asynchronous</strong></h2>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>React may batch multiple&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls into a single update for performance. Calls to&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;are asynchronous when they are inside event handlers and that when you don’t rely on&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;to reflect the new value immediately after calling&nbsp;<em>setState</em>.</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br>// Note: this will *not* work as intended.<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong>count: this.state.count + 1<strong>}</strong>);<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>&nbsp;this</strong>.incrementCount();<br>// When React re-renders the component, `this.state.count` will be 1, but you expected 3.</p>



<p>// This is because `incrementCount()` function above reads from `this.state.count`,<br>// but React doesn’t update `this.state.count` until the component is re-rendered.<br>// So `incrementCount()` ends up reading `this.state.count` as 0 every time, and sets it to 1.</p>



<p>To fix it, use a second form of&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;that accepts a function rather than an object to ensure the call always uses the most updated version of&nbsp;<em>state</em>. i hope now it’s clear to you&nbsp;<strong>What is State in React?</strong></p>



<p>Passing an update function allows you to access the&nbsp;<em>current state value</em>&nbsp;inside the updater. Since&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;calls are batched, this lets you chain updates and ensure they build on top of each other instead of conflicting:</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; {<br>// Important: read `state` instead of `this.state` when updating.<br>return {count:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.count + 1}<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();</p>



<p>// If you read `this.state.count` now, it would still be 0.<br>// But when React re-renders the component, it will be 3.<br>}</p>



<p>Also you can pass&nbsp;<em>props</em>&nbsp;as a second argument at the time the update is applied:</p>



<p>// Correct<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>props)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; ({<br>counter:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.counter +&nbsp;<strong>props</strong>.increment<br>}));</p>



<p><strong>State Updates are Merged</strong></p>



<p>When you call&nbsp;setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.</p>



<p>For instance, your state may contain several independent variables:</p>



<p>constructor(<strong>props</strong>) {<br>super(<strong>props</strong>);<br><strong>this</strong>.state = {<br>posts: [],<br>comments: []<br>};<br>}</p>



<p>Then you can update them independently with separate&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls:</p>



<p>componentDidMount() {<br>fetchPosts().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>posts: response.posts<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});</p>



<p>fetchComments().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>comments: response.comments<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>The merging is shallow, so&nbsp;this.setState({comments})&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;this.state.posts&nbsp;intact, but completely replaces&nbsp;this.state.comments.</p>



<p>You might be asking what is&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;and how it is used. It is a method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. So if you need to load data from a remote endpoint (API), this is a good place to instantiate the network request.</p>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>As you can see in the above example the properties for&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;are now independent and separately added&nbsp;this.setState&nbsp;, passed an object to each property and surrounded them by&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;where they will be added to the DOM tree after we get the response from the&nbsp;fetchPosts()&nbsp;and&nbsp;fetchComments().</p>

<p>Today we will learn about <strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components</strong>. In the previous article I had talk about<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"> </span><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/how-to-become-a-salesforce-developer/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">How to become a Salesforce Developer</span></a></strong>.The <strong>Lightning Component</strong> framework is a UI framework for developing web apps for mobile and desktop devices. It’s a modern framework for building single-page applications with dynamic, responsive user interfaces for <strong>Lightning</strong> Platform apps. It uses JavaScript on the client side and Apex on the server side. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introducing Lightning Web Components</strong></h2>



<p>Now you can build Lightning components using two programming models:&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Web Components</strong>, and the original model,&nbsp;<strong>Aura Components</strong>. Lightning web components are custom HTML elements built using&nbsp;<strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;and modern&nbsp;<strong>JavaScript</strong>. Lightning web components and Aura components can coexist and interoperate on a page. To admins and end users, they both appear as Lightning components.&nbsp;<strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components.</strong></p>



<p>Lightning Web Components uses core Web Components standards and provides only what’s necessary to perform well in browsers supported by Salesforce. Because it’s built on code that runs natively in browsers, Lightning Web Components is lightweight and delivers exceptional performance. Most of the code you write is standard JavaScript and HTML.</p>



<p>Salesforce is committed to developing open web standards and is a member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp;<strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components.</strong></p>



<p>Base Lightning components are available as&nbsp;<strong>Aura components</strong>&nbsp;and as&nbsp;<strong>Lightning web components</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>Component Reference&nbsp;</strong>includes documentation, specifications, and examples for both. See Base Components: Aura Vs Lightning Web Components for differences between them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create Lightning Web Components</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="705" height="430" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5584" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce.png 705w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-300x183.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-696x425.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-689x420.png 689w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure>



<p>A Lightning web component is a reusable custom HTML element with its own API.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Define a Component</strong></h2>



<p>A Lightning web component that renders UI must include an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a metadata configuration file. The files must use the same name so the framework can autowire them. A service component (library) must include a JavaScript file and a metadata configuration file.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTML Templates</strong></h2>



<p>The power of Lightning Web Components is the templating system, which uses the virtual DOM to render components smartly and efficiently. It’s a best practice to let LWC manipulate the DOM instead of writing JavaScript to do it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CSS</strong></h2>



<p>To style components, use Lightning Design System or CSS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reactivity</strong></h2>



<p>Reactivity is a system at the core of the Lightning Web Components framework. The framework observes changes to the values of fields and properties. When it observes a change, it reacts. It reevaluates all the expressions used in the template and rerenders the component, which displays the new values.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Composition</strong></h2>



<p>You can add components within the body of another component. Composition enables you to build complex components from simpler building-block components.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fields, Properties, and Attributes</strong></h2>



<p>Declare fields in your component’s JavaScript class. Reference them in your component’s template to dynamically update content.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>Every component must have a JavaScript file. JavaScript files in Lightning web components are ES6 modules.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Access Static Resources, Labels, Internationalization Properties, User IDs, and Form Factors</strong></h2>



<p>Lightning components can access global Salesforce values, such as labels, resources, and users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Component Accessibility</strong></h2>



<p>Accessible software and assistive technologies enable users with disabilities to use the products you build. Develop your components so that all users can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Component Lifecycle</strong></h2>



<p>Lightning web components have a lifecycle managed by the framework. The framework creates components, inserts them into the DOM, renders them, and removes them from the DOM. It also monitors components for property changes. Generally, components don’t need to call these lifecycle hooks, but it is possible.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn about&nbsp;<strong>the top five programming languages of the world</strong>, you should start learning now.</p>



<p>Have you ever heard of python? C? C++?Java? All will say “what are you talking about? A non-programmer ever know this!” That’s true. IncludeHelp also knows that his readers have already explored a few miles on the road of C, C++, Java, and Python. Maybe still miles to go, but you all know about the languages. Below is the <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Python</strong></h2>



<p>This century loves to work with data, loves to train their machine and believes in artificial intelligence. Python is such a genuine &amp; general purpose language that helps you to explore all that you want to do. Python has been announced as the “most popular language of 2024” by&nbsp;TIOBE index. We believe the same too. Python is probably the best weapon of a geek who is working on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development of course.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Python first:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not difficult to learn</li><li>Multiple programming paradigms</li><li>Robust standard library</li><li>A nice platform for developers</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>We have listed JavaScript as 2nd one due to his huge usage and demand in the ongoing tech-world. JavaScript is the basic building block for any frontend application. Now a days NodeJs is widely used for website development frameworks, which is actually JavaScript based.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JavaScript:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Must one for Full-stack developer</li><li>Needed to fame any frontend application</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Swift</strong></h2>

<p>When booting up computer, if the BIOS (basic input/out system) fails to find an operating system, one of the above error messages will appear. The error messages, alerts, warnings, and symptoms below are tied to this error.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Operating System not found” error screen on startup</h2>



<p>You can see a error like this &#8220;Operating system not found&#8221;. When a PC&nbsp;is booting, the BIOS tries to&nbsp;find a operating system on a&nbsp;hard drive to boot from. However, if it is unable to find one, then an “Operating system not found” error is displayed. It may be caused by an error in BIOS configuration, a faulty hard drive, or a damaged Master Boot Record.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Following are the solutions to this issue</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 1. Check BIOS settings to see whether it recognize the hard disk or not</strong></h3>



<p>1. Restart the machine and press certain key (usually F10, F12, Esc, Del, etc.) to enter BIOS.                                                                                                                2. In BIOS main tab, check whether it detect the Windows installation disk or not. They are Primary Master, Primary Slave, Secondary Master, Secondary Slave, etc.</p>



<p>The methodology for entering the BIOS changes from manufacturer to manufacturer. Typically, you&#8217;ll need to press&nbsp;<strong>Escape</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>, or one of the&nbsp;<strong>Function keys</strong>. You should see an onscreen message advising you which is the correct key during the boot process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 2. Reset The BIOS</strong> </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="980" height="536" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1.png" alt="Operating System Not Found? Here is the solution to Fix It " class="wp-image-5574" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1.png 980w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1-300x164.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1-768x420.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1-696x381.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></figure>



<p>If your machine is not recognizing your hard drive, there are lots of possible causes. For non-tech-savvy users, the only easy solution is to try resetting the entire BIOS menu to its default values.<br><br>At the bottom of the BIOS menu, you should see a key for&nbsp;<strong>Setup Defaults</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Reset BIOS</strong>. On my machine it&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>F9</strong>, but it might be different on yours. Confirm your decision when prompted and restart your machine.<br><br>If the operating system is still not found, you can stop reading this article. Unless you know a lot about building computers, you&#8217;ll need to take your machine to a computer repair shop.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 3. Run automatic repair</strong></h3>



<p>Windows built-in Automatic Repair may repair some boot process related problems in some situations. Here, you should prepare Windows installation disk or Windows repair disk. </p>



<p>1. Boot from the Windows installation disk or Windows repair disk.<br>2. Choose your language, time and keyboard input and click “Next”.<br>3. Click on “Repair your computer”.<br>4. Select “Troubleshot” and then “Advanced” option.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 4. Fix The Boot Records</strong></h3>



<p>Windows primarily relies on three records to boot your machine. They are the&nbsp;<strong>Master Boot Record</strong>&nbsp;(MBR),&nbsp;<strong>DOS Boot Record</strong>&nbsp;(DBR), and the&nbsp;<strong>Boot Configuration Database</strong>&nbsp;(BCD). <br>If any of the three records becomes damaged or corrupted, there&#8217;s a high chance you&#8217;ll encounter the &#8220;Operating system not found&#8221; message. </p>



<p>Next, navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt</strong>. When Command Prompt loads, type the following three commands. Press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>&nbsp;after each of them: <strong>bootrec.exe /fixmbr</strong> &gt; <strong>bootrec.exe /fixboot</strong> &gt; <strong>bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd</strong></p>
