<p><strong>DevOps&nbsp;</strong>is a new buzz in the world of IT. People interpret it as software but it is a&nbsp;<strong>concept</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>approach</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>methodology that combines software development and Information Technology to shorten the System Development Life Cycle.</strong></p>



<p>It is the offspring of agile software development, from the past few decades there is a need for a more holistic approach to the end to end Software Delivery Life-cycle. DevOps use the approach, practices and tools that increase an organization able to deliver Applications and Services at high velocity and throughput in comparison to the organization uses a traditional approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">chain of tools used commonly in<strong>&nbsp;DevOps environments</strong>.&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="991" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg" alt="What is DevOps" class="wp-image-5579" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-300x290.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-768x743.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1536x1486.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-696x673.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1068x1033.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-434x420.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Coding:&nbsp;</strong>Develop the code and review it, source code managing and merging tools.</p>



<p><strong>Building and Testing</strong>: These includes continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment tools with an emphasis on task automation. It also includes pre-deployment staging.</p>



<p><strong>Releasing:&nbsp;</strong>release approvals, release automation or deployment of software or applications</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring&nbsp;</strong>Other products to support DevOps include&nbsp;<strong>real-time monitoring</strong>&nbsp;and incident response systems, as well as collaboration platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes DevOps different from Agile?</strong></h2>



<p>So I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is DevOps?</strong>&nbsp;But what makes it different from previous methods like agile. The main difference is it works in real-time with more velocity that helps the development and operation team to get the updates and make changes efficiently according to customers and market needs which leads to<strong>&nbsp;Rapid Delivery</strong>&nbsp;of Products. Use practises like&nbsp;<strong>continuous integration</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>continuous delivery</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring and logging</strong>&nbsp;make this concept more &nbsp;<strong>reliable</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>scalable</strong>&nbsp;as is used for the cloud. Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>&nbsp;by using&nbsp;<strong>automated compliance policies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>fine-grained controls</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>configuration management</strong>&nbsp;techniques.</p>

<p>In this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss</strong>. In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I’ve heard it all:</p>



<ul><li>“You can’t have privacy if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have security if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t get upgrades if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have a good user experience if you use Android!”</li><li>“YOU CAN’T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!”</li></ul>



<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;</em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I’m here to tell you they’re all equally misguided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now, don’t get me wrong:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a&nbsp;<em>nugget</em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we’re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don’t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don’t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).</p>



<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself — as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform — overlooks one key point. It’s a foundational reality of Android that’s been at the system’s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches</strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app’s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</strong></p>



<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner — that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;an “Android way” — not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.</p>



<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it’s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Same level of choice and control</strong></h2>



<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world’s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.</p>



<p>It’s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story — the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choice and control within Android</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll start with privacy — an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn’t actually that it’s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It’s simply that Google’s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don’t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it — at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.</p>



<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults — and most people aren’t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What’s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide</strong>; it’s just up to you to embrace it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>What about security? Well, it’s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources —&nbsp;<em>the horror!</em>&nbsp;— but, y’know, it’s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they’ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It’s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>That brings us to the realm of updates — both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It’s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion</strong></h2>



<p>The Pixel, as I’ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It’s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company’s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be — a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn’t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it’s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>to make. There’s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone’s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities — and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Android and iOS</strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates ’em. Neither platform’s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.</p>

<p>Introduction to D3.js for data visualization. D3.js is a JavaScript library used to manipulate documents based on data. It uses HTML, CSS, and SVG to create visual representations of data which can be viewed on any modern browser. it is a&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;tool.</p>



<p>Create a folder named&nbsp;<strong>d3js_projects</strong>. Create an HTML file in the folder named&nbsp;<strong>project_1.html</strong>.&nbsp; You can also learn about&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/">Easyshiksha Certification</a></strong></p>



<p>create a simple html web page</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;title&gt;My first page&lt;/title&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;body&gt; Web Page&lt;/body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>after this just setup D3.js with this code in head element. Rember one thing script code will be written in head elament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;script&nbsp;type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&nbsp;src=&#8221;d3.v2.min.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="310" height="163" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5563" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png 310w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After this setup the source</strong></h2>



<p>To test our D3.js setup we open the inspect element tool kit.</p>



<p>In the element tab of webkit Inspector, we open all of the elements so that we can see the whole HTML structure.&nbsp;we then hover over the d3.vs.min.js src.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOM Section</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;Using D3.js, we can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), meaning we can select elements and apply various transformations on the data visualization.</p>



<p><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;Learn D3 in 5 minutes&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Today is a beautiful day!!&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;script src='https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;<br>d3.select('h3').style('color', 'darkblue');<br>d3.select('h3').style('font-size', '24px');&lt;/script&gt;<br><br></code></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">select method is used to make manupulations and or add data in a element.</h2>



<p>So we’re simply chaining the&nbsp;<code>select()</code>&nbsp;method on the&nbsp;<code>d3</code>&nbsp;object, and then following up with&nbsp;<code>style()</code>. The first parameter dictates what we want to change and the second gives the value. Here’s the result:</p>



<p>The next concept you’ll need to learn is data binding, as that’s one of the coolest features of D3. Using it, we can populate or manipulate DOM elements in real-time. Introduction to D3.js for data visualization</p>



<p>In our HTML, we have a simple unordered list&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>ul&gt;:&nbsp; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>



<p>We want to create the list elements using a data object. Here’s the code for doing exactly that:</p>



<p>&lt;script&gt;</p>



<p>var languages=[&#8216;java&#8217;, &#8216;python&#8217;, &#8216;javascript&#8217;, &#8216;c++&#8217;];</p>



<p>d3.select(&#8220;ul&#8221;) //firstly we will select the ul</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp; .selectAll(&#8220;li&#8221;) //now we are selecting all the data is li as a array. but li is no present in code</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp;.data(languages) //language is the array passed in data it will run up to 4 times</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; .enter() // enter will check if li is present or not</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;.append(&#8220;li&#8221;) // with append we will add li</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"> .text(function(d){return d;});&nbsp;</h5>



<p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p>In this Article, you will get an introduction of Robotic Process Automation. RPA is a software technology based on software robots to perform certain Artificial Intelligence tasks like control Desktop applications, collect or gather data, store data to other applications, manipulate and modify data.</p>



<p>Robotic process automation (RPA) allows using software robots instead of people to drive the business. It enables you to automate regular tasks so that user can concentrate on complex tasks rather than routine work manually. This will leads to less chance of error and efficient work .</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Robotic Process Automation Examples</h2>



<p>RPA enables an business to make use of software robots to finish all  tasks within a given time. Helps to improvise the customer satisfaction. Robotic Process Automation is best suited for suited for processes that are clearly defined and well documented, repeatable without many changes and also if they are rules-based.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">RPA Architecture Components</h2>



<p>The architecture of any RPA tool is very complex and has multiple components. RPA is composed of the following main components:</p>



<ul><li>Authoring tool  includes workflow designs and recorder</li><li>Runtime environment includes RPA central, RPA Bot and Queue<ul><li>RPA Central</li><li>RPA Bot</li><li>Queue</li></ul></li><li>Self Service end-user interface<ul><li>Self Service X</li></ul></li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tools for RPA</h2>



<p>No matter what RPA software you use, its tools should have several capabilities. They should be able to automate multiple kinds of application environments, including Citrix, desktop, and web environments. List of few tools that are very commonly used.</p>



<p>UI Path</p>



<p><strong>Uipath</strong>&nbsp;was founded in 2005, and it is the most popular RPA automation tool in the current market.</p>



<p>The great thing about Uipath is that it provides a community edition to people who want to learn, practice, and implement RPA. Features of Uipath are:</p>



<p>Multiple hosting can host across multiple virtual machines and cloud. Compact-able applications work on desktop, mainframes, web apps.</p>



<p><strong>Automation Anywhere</strong></p>



<p>Automation Anywhere was developed in 2003 in San Jose. It is the leading RPA tool use globally. Easy to use require no programming skills. It is easy to integrate this with any platform.</p>



<p><strong>Blue Prism</strong></p>



<p><strong>Blue prism</strong>&nbsp;is capable of providing the virtual workforce powered by robots.&nbsp;It requires a deep knowledge of programming. It is more robust, secure based on java so work on OOPs concepts. Easy to scale based on the requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Quantum internet breakthrough could help make hacking a thing</strong>. The advent of mass working from home has made many people more aware of the security risks of sending sensitive information via the internet. The best we can do at the moment is make it difficult to intercept and hack your messages – but we can’t make it impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we need is a new type of internet:</h2>



<p> the quantum internet. In this version of the global network, data is secure, connections are private and your worries about information being intercepted are a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Our current way of protecting online data is to encrypt it using mathematical problem that are easy to solve if you have a digital “key” to unlock the encryption but hard to solve without it. However, hard does not mean impossible and, with enough time and computer power, today’s methods of encryption can be broken.</p>



<p>Entanglement is so useful that it is set to become a resource itself, like data or electricity or water. And the primary purpose of the quantum internet is to distribute and exploit this resource in the form of entangled particles.</p>



<p>Quantum communication, on the other hand, creates keys using individual particles of light (photons) , which – according to the principles of quantum physics – are impossible to make an exact copy of. Any attempt to copy these keys will unavoidably cause errors that can be detected. This means a hacker, no matter how clever or powerful they are or what kind of supercomputer they possess, cannot replicate a quantum key or read the message it encrypts.</p>



<p>There is a catch, however. Entanglement is relatively straightforward to produce — quantum optics labs all over the world can produce it more or less on demand. But it is fragile, hard to store and tricky to transmit.</p>



<p>That’s why quantum networks are so difficult to build. Almost any outside interference destroys entanglement. Sneeze and you lose it.</p>



<p>So much of the practical work involved in creating quantum networks is in purifying, storing and boosting entanglement as it travels over long distances.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn about&nbsp;<strong>the top five programming languages of the world</strong>, you should start learning now.</p>



<p>Have you ever heard of python? C? C++?Java? All will say “what are you talking about? A non-programmer ever know this!” That’s true. IncludeHelp also knows that his readers have already explored a few miles on the road of C, C++, Java, and Python. Maybe still miles to go, but you all know about the languages. Below is the <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Python</strong></h2>



<p>This century loves to work with data, loves to train their machine and believes in artificial intelligence. Python is such a genuine &amp; general purpose language that helps you to explore all that you want to do. Python has been announced as the “most popular language of 2024” by&nbsp;TIOBE index. We believe the same too. Python is probably the best weapon of a geek who is working on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development of course.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Python first:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not difficult to learn</li><li>Multiple programming paradigms</li><li>Robust standard library</li><li>A nice platform for developers</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>We have listed JavaScript as 2nd one due to his huge usage and demand in the ongoing tech-world. JavaScript is the basic building block for any frontend application. Now a days NodeJs is widely used for website development frameworks, which is actually JavaScript based.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JavaScript:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Must one for Full-stack developer</li><li>Needed to fame any frontend application</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Swift</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png" alt="Top Five Programming Languages of the World" class="wp-image-5728" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-300x171.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-768x439.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-696x398.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-735x420.png 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Swift is a scripting language which has become so popular in last few years only. It was launched in 2014 and has introduced now a high-paid career path. This is mainly being used in distributed computing as it allows writing scripts that distribute program execution across distributed computing resources, including clusters, clouds, grids, and supercomputers.Swift is being constantly used in economic and biometric modelling.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Swift:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Has a great future opportunity regarding career</li><li>A really nice scripting language4.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Java</h2>



<p>You all are familiar a bit with Java. Probably, this was the language you learnt in your past school times or maybe junior college days. Java is powerful for its Object Oriented paradigm. Java is most famous for android development, IOT, edge device development. Strong OOP concept felicitates java as top application developing language.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JAVA:</strong></p>



<p>Object oriented nature Java applets</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. C++</strong></h2>



<p>C++ is known to be a core language. It’s a highly efficient &amp; reliable language. It has been on demand due to high performance &amp; wide usage. Do you know Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X Google application (most of them), Mozilla Firefox, Adobe systems (major applications) are written in C++? <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about Will robots and AI take our jobs in covid-19’s socially distanced era? Coronavirus has put a rocket below plans for extra automation, roboticisation and use of AI. Ought to we worry for our jobs – or will we simply get higher ones?</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a fundamental impact on the global labour market in the next few years. Therefore, the authors discuss legal, economic and business issues, such as changes in the future labour market and in company structures, impact on working time, remuneration and on the working environment, new forms of employment and the impact on labour relations.</p>



<p>At many places you can see clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst<strong> UV Bot, with its 1000 watts’ </strong>worth of UVC light capable of “tearing apart strands of virus DNA”, comes here every night, as well as to a few other<strong> malls and hospitals in Singapore</strong>. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the covid-19 pandemic: cleaning.</p>



<p>Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals, Moxi delivers medications, lab samples and supplies. P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets. James the telepresence bot helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking the coronavirus’s genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.</p>



<p>This trend towards automation and roboticisation isn’t new – but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. “What this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance”, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. “In these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.”</p>



<p>And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone – with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?</p>



<p>So is there any solution to this problem is Robot is going to capture the market which will lead to unemployment. But yes in today&#8217;s time it is difficult to get a robot for petty works because it&#8217;s costing is too high but yes in future we are going to totally rely on robots for petty work also.</p>

<p>When booting up computer, if the BIOS (basic input/out system) fails to find an operating system, one of the above error messages will appear. The error messages, alerts, warnings, and symptoms below are tied to this error.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Operating System not found” error screen on startup</h2>



<p>You can see a error like this &#8220;Operating system not found&#8221;. When a PC&nbsp;is booting, the BIOS tries to&nbsp;find a operating system on a&nbsp;hard drive to boot from. However, if it is unable to find one, then an “Operating system not found” error is displayed. It may be caused by an error in BIOS configuration, a faulty hard drive, or a damaged Master Boot Record.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Following are the solutions to this issue</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 1. Check BIOS settings to see whether it recognize the hard disk or not</strong></h3>



<p>1. Restart the machine and press certain key (usually F10, F12, Esc, Del, etc.) to enter BIOS.                                                                                                                2. In BIOS main tab, check whether it detect the Windows installation disk or not. They are Primary Master, Primary Slave, Secondary Master, Secondary Slave, etc.</p>



<p>The methodology for entering the BIOS changes from manufacturer to manufacturer. Typically, you&#8217;ll need to press&nbsp;<strong>Escape</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>, or one of the&nbsp;<strong>Function keys</strong>. You should see an onscreen message advising you which is the correct key during the boot process.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 2. Reset The BIOS</strong> </h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="980" height="536" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1.png" alt="Operating System Not Found? Here is the solution to Fix It " class="wp-image-5574" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1.png 980w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1-300x164.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1-768x420.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/operating-system-1-696x381.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 980px) 100vw, 980px" /></figure>



<p>If your machine is not recognizing your hard drive, there are lots of possible causes. For non-tech-savvy users, the only easy solution is to try resetting the entire BIOS menu to its default values.<br><br>At the bottom of the BIOS menu, you should see a key for&nbsp;<strong>Setup Defaults</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Reset BIOS</strong>. On my machine it&#8217;s&nbsp;<strong>F9</strong>, but it might be different on yours. Confirm your decision when prompted and restart your machine.<br><br>If the operating system is still not found, you can stop reading this article. Unless you know a lot about building computers, you&#8217;ll need to take your machine to a computer repair shop.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 3. Run automatic repair</strong></h3>



<p>Windows built-in Automatic Repair may repair some boot process related problems in some situations. Here, you should prepare Windows installation disk or Windows repair disk. </p>



<p>1. Boot from the Windows installation disk or Windows repair disk.<br>2. Choose your language, time and keyboard input and click “Next”.<br>3. Click on “Repair your computer”.<br>4. Select “Troubleshot” and then “Advanced” option.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solution 4. Fix The Boot Records</strong></h3>



<p>Windows primarily relies on three records to boot your machine. They are the&nbsp;<strong>Master Boot Record</strong>&nbsp;(MBR),&nbsp;<strong>DOS Boot Record</strong>&nbsp;(DBR), and the&nbsp;<strong>Boot Configuration Database</strong>&nbsp;(BCD). <br>If any of the three records becomes damaged or corrupted, there&#8217;s a high chance you&#8217;ll encounter the &#8220;Operating system not found&#8221; message. </p>



<p>Next, navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Command Prompt</strong>. When Command Prompt loads, type the following three commands. Press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong>&nbsp;after each of them: <strong>bootrec.exe /fixmbr</strong> &gt; <strong>bootrec.exe /fixboot</strong> &gt; <strong>bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd</strong></p>
