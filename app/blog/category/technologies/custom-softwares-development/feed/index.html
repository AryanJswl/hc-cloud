<p><strong>DevOps&nbsp;</strong>is a new buzz in the world of IT. People interpret it as software but it is a&nbsp;<strong>concept</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>approach</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>methodology that combines software development and Information Technology to shorten the System Development Life Cycle.</strong></p>



<p>It is the offspring of agile software development, from the past few decades there is a need for a more holistic approach to the end to end Software Delivery Life-cycle. DevOps use the approach, practices and tools that increase an organization able to deliver Applications and Services at high velocity and throughput in comparison to the organization uses a traditional approach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">chain of tools used commonly in<strong>&nbsp;DevOps environments</strong>.&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="991" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg" alt="What is DevOps" class="wp-image-5579" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1024x991.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-300x290.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-768x743.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1536x1486.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-scaled.jpg 2048w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-696x673.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-1068x1033.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/DevOps-Venn-Diagram-434x420.jpg 434w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Coding:&nbsp;</strong>Develop the code and review it, source code managing and merging tools.</p>



<p><strong>Building and Testing</strong>: These includes continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment tools with an emphasis on task automation. It also includes pre-deployment staging.</p>



<p><strong>Releasing:&nbsp;</strong>release approvals, release automation or deployment of software or applications</p>



<p><strong>Monitoring&nbsp;</strong>Other products to support DevOps include&nbsp;<strong>real-time monitoring</strong>&nbsp;and incident response systems, as well as collaboration platforms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes DevOps different from Agile?</strong></h2>



<p>So I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is DevOps?</strong>&nbsp;But what makes it different from previous methods like agile. The main difference is it works in real-time with more velocity that helps the development and operation team to get the updates and make changes efficiently according to customers and market needs which leads to<strong>&nbsp;Rapid Delivery</strong>&nbsp;of Products. Use practises like&nbsp;<strong>continuous integration</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>continuous delivery</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Monitoring and logging</strong>&nbsp;make this concept more &nbsp;<strong>reliable</strong> &nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>scalable</strong>&nbsp;as is used for the cloud. Move quickly while retaining control and preserving compliance. You can adopt a DevOps model without sacrificing&nbsp;<strong>security</strong>&nbsp;by using&nbsp;<strong>automated compliance policies</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>fine-grained controls</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>configuration management</strong>&nbsp;techniques.</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about the how to create wireframes for your application. Wireframes are the base of any application. </p>



<p>Regardless of how excellent your idea for a&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;is, if you don’t know where to start and how to go about it, it will fail. Our consistent response to such confusion is – wireframe!</p>



<p style="font-size:0"><strong><span style="color:#27aae2" class="has-inline-color">Wireframing</span></strong> is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on the way client want to see your application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Wireframe Show?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, it’s a two-dimensional skeleton of what your future mobile app will look like. It shows:</p>



<ul><li>Content prioritization</li><li>Space distribution</li><li>Intended actions</li><li>Available features and functions</li><li>Transitions between screens</li></ul>



<p><strong>Wireframes</strong> can drawn on paper, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your <strong>website or product</strong>. In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:</p>



<ul><li>Wireframe &gt; Interactive Prototype &gt; Visual &gt; Design</li><li>Sketch &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Hi-Def Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Integral Aspects of a Website</h2>



<p>In the beginning focus on integral aspects of a website. Firstly don’t even consider the design aesthetics for now. The colors, themes, fonts, and images can be taken care of later.</p>



<p>You must have a clear understanding of the features you need in your final product.&nbsp;Prepare a list and include all the things you actually need in your app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to aim at excellent user experience with your app. What’s the first thing users will see after launching your app? How will this screen guide them for further navigation? How can users take specific actions? Is it going to be easier for them to figure out?</p>



<p>UX can be abstract and complicated. Because, just like everything else on the Internet, the UX is also evolving at a tremendous pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now you are ready to start putting these ideas down. </h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to use pen and paper to start designing your UX, UI when there are tonnes of applications available in the market which that you can easy build one for you. </p>



<p>Now before ending this I want to share some tools name that can be very useful for building wireframes.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><strong>Balsmiq</strong>, <strong>draw.io</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>, <strong>Figma</strong> are the free tools available online. You can easily start working on these start putting your ideas and start building your application.</p>

<p>Today we will learn about <strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components</strong>. In the previous article I had talk about<span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"> </span><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/how-to-become-a-salesforce-developer/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">How to become a Salesforce Developer</span></a></strong>.The <strong>Lightning Component</strong> framework is a UI framework for developing web apps for mobile and desktop devices. It’s a modern framework for building single-page applications with dynamic, responsive user interfaces for <strong>Lightning</strong> Platform apps. It uses JavaScript on the client side and Apex on the server side. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Introducing Lightning Web Components</strong></h2>



<p>Now you can build Lightning components using two programming models:&nbsp;<strong>Lightning Web Components</strong>, and the original model,&nbsp;<strong>Aura Components</strong>. Lightning web components are custom HTML elements built using&nbsp;<strong>HTML</strong>&nbsp;and modern&nbsp;<strong>JavaScript</strong>. Lightning web components and Aura components can coexist and interoperate on a page. To admins and end users, they both appear as Lightning components.&nbsp;<strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components.</strong></p>



<p>Lightning Web Components uses core Web Components standards and provides only what’s necessary to perform well in browsers supported by Salesforce. Because it’s built on code that runs natively in browsers, Lightning Web Components is lightweight and delivers exceptional performance. Most of the code you write is standard JavaScript and HTML.</p>



<p>Salesforce is committed to developing open web standards and is a member of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).&nbsp;<strong>Salesforce Lightning Web Components.</strong></p>



<p>Base Lightning components are available as&nbsp;<strong>Aura components</strong>&nbsp;and as&nbsp;<strong>Lightning web components</strong>. The&nbsp;<strong>Component Reference&nbsp;</strong>includes documentation, specifications, and examples for both. See Base Components: Aura Vs Lightning Web Components for differences between them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create Lightning Web Components</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="705" height="430" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5584" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce.png 705w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-300x183.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-696x425.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/salesforce-689x420.png 689w" sizes="(max-width: 705px) 100vw, 705px" /></figure>



<p>A Lightning web component is a reusable custom HTML element with its own API.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Define a Component</strong></h2>



<p>A Lightning web component that renders UI must include an HTML file, a JavaScript file, and a metadata configuration file. The files must use the same name so the framework can autowire them. A service component (library) must include a JavaScript file and a metadata configuration file.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTML Templates</strong></h2>



<p>The power of Lightning Web Components is the templating system, which uses the virtual DOM to render components smartly and efficiently. It’s a best practice to let LWC manipulate the DOM instead of writing JavaScript to do it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>CSS</strong></h2>



<p>To style components, use Lightning Design System or CSS.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reactivity</strong></h2>



<p>Reactivity is a system at the core of the Lightning Web Components framework. The framework observes changes to the values of fields and properties. When it observes a change, it reacts. It reevaluates all the expressions used in the template and rerenders the component, which displays the new values.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Composition</strong></h2>



<p>You can add components within the body of another component. Composition enables you to build complex components from simpler building-block components.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Fields, Properties, and Attributes</strong></h2>



<p>Declare fields in your component’s JavaScript class. Reference them in your component’s template to dynamically update content.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>Every component must have a JavaScript file. JavaScript files in Lightning web components are ES6 modules.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Access Static Resources, Labels, Internationalization Properties, User IDs, and Form Factors</strong></h2>



<p>Lightning components can access global Salesforce values, such as labels, resources, and users.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Component Accessibility</strong></h2>



<p>Accessible software and assistive technologies enable users with disabilities to use the products you build. Develop your components so that all users can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with them.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Component Lifecycle</strong></h2>



<p>Lightning web components have a lifecycle managed by the framework. The framework creates components, inserts them into the DOM, renders them, and removes them from the DOM. It also monitors components for property changes. Generally, components don’t need to call these lifecycle hooks, but it is possible.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn about&nbsp;<strong>the top five programming languages of the world</strong>, you should start learning now.</p>



<p>Have you ever heard of python? C? C++?Java? All will say “what are you talking about? A non-programmer ever know this!” That’s true. IncludeHelp also knows that his readers have already explored a few miles on the road of C, C++, Java, and Python. Maybe still miles to go, but you all know about the languages. Below is the <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Python</strong></h2>



<p>This century loves to work with data, loves to train their machine and believes in artificial intelligence. Python is such a genuine &amp; general purpose language that helps you to explore all that you want to do. Python has been announced as the “most popular language of 2024” by&nbsp;TIOBE index. We believe the same too. Python is probably the best weapon of a geek who is working on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development of course.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Python first:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not difficult to learn</li><li>Multiple programming paradigms</li><li>Robust standard library</li><li>A nice platform for developers</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>We have listed JavaScript as 2nd one due to his huge usage and demand in the ongoing tech-world. JavaScript is the basic building block for any frontend application. Now a days NodeJs is widely used for website development frameworks, which is actually JavaScript based.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JavaScript:</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5361" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development-.jpg" alt="The Future Revolution of Software Development" width="800" height="500" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development-.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--300x188.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--768x480.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--696x435.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/The-Future-Revolution-of-Software-Development--672x420.jpg 672w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" />The current decade and also the world of how we develop and deploy software is now changing incredibly fast. In 2010 many groups had already adopted practices such as Agile, Test Driven Development (TDD), as well as Continuous Integration (CI), but the vast majority of development teams were still doing things the conservative way, with big Product Requirement Documents, year or multi-year-long development cycles with a multi-month code-freeze and QA interval at the end. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">A shockingly large number of software jobs did not even have any kind of comprehensive regular regression testing. Five years later, just about everyone uses some kind of Agile with a decent test-suite, and those published on a yearly or quarterly cadence are the laggards, firmly in the minority; most software jobs release or deploy new versions multiple times a month and some even a few times per day. By moving out of the old, waterfall style to Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Deployment (CD) and adopting DevOps, new attributes are introduced quicker, delivering competitive advantage and reacting more quickly to consumer needs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The wider digital market has obviously been undergoing huge changes at the exact same moment. The computer software is ever-more vital to the world we live in. </span>Waymo&#8217;s<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> self-driving cars lately passed eight million miles travelled. Microsoft&#8217;s translation engine, even though not fluent in six million forms of communication, can match human levels of accuracy in Chinese-to-English tasks.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; color: #333399;">In this new world, developers no longer need to design a unique algorithm for each problem. Most work focuses, instead, on generating datasets that reflect the desired behaviour and managing the training process. Pete Warden from Google’s TensorFlow team pointed this out as far back as 2014: “I used to be a coder,” he wrote. “Now I teach computers to write their own programs.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The Coming </b><b>Revolution </b><b>in Software Development</b></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>Programming and data science will converge</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Most applications will not include &#8220;end-to-end&#8221; learning systems for the foreseeable future. It will rely on information models to provide core cognition capacities and explicit logic to interface with customers and interpret results.  </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>AI professionals will be rock stars</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Doing AI is hard. Rank-and-file AI programmers &#8211; not just brilliant academics and researchers &#8211; will probably be one of the most valuable resources for software companies later on.  </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"><b>The AI toolchain needs to be constructed</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">&#8220;Machine learning is at the primordial soup phase. You really had to be a world&#8217;s expert to find these things to function.&#8221; Studies also show that many AI versions are tough to explain, trivial to fool and susceptible to bias. Tools to tackle these problems, among others, will be essential to </span>unlocking<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"> the potential of AI programmers. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The core breakthrough supporting every one of those advances is deep learning, an artificial intelligence technique motivated by the structure of the human brain. What started as a relatively narrow data analysis tool now functions as something close to a general computing platform. It outperforms traditional software across a broad assortment of jobs and may finally deliver the intelligent systems which have long eluded computer scientists &#8211; feats which the press sometimes blow out of proportion. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">As software controls more and more of the planet around us, programs no longer function in isolation, but interact with other applications and operate on multiple devices in an increasingly complex ecosystem. Modern practices didn&#8217;t make life easier for long; rather they allow us to perform more and so complexity increased.</span></p>

Many organization is moving to the cloud for application, service or infrastructure deployment. But cloud computing and service is a very broad concept to understand. It is important to understand the difference between these cloud services. Many companies use these services to accelerate their product development, offload work etc. This article is going to cover these three ‘as a service’ with their definition, difference and comparison.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>SaaS- Software as a Service:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/saas-development/" target="_blank">Software as a Service</a></strong></span> (SaaS) is one big part of the cloud service world. It spread so fast across businesses and it is still growing. SaaS is actually an application service that needs web-browser to run itself. No installation or setup or space in the system required. Still, some SaaS require plug-in support and installation to do some extra task. Third-party here manage the services, management and its deployment. For example, you can look at CRM app like Salesforce, cloud suites like Google Apps, DropBox and other. One of the good reasons to use this services is that it is cost-effective. SaaS service comes on the subscription basis. So you only pay till you need them. You don’t have to make a one-time big purchase.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>PaaS- Platform as a Service:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Platform as a Service (PaaS) may be less used than the SaaS but it has proved its worth in time. If you are into development PaaS provide you a platform to do make the custom application. The server, maintenance and updates are still controlled by the third party application. This allows developers to focus on the <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">software development</a></span></strong></span>. About the installation, OS, storage and infrastructure these will be controlled by the enterprise or third party. Application developed on the PaaS have components inherited from cloud service. So these developed software are high availability, tenancy and scalability. PaaS has several benefits that we can count on. Reduced amount of code to be done, migration of app and implementation of business policy are few of them.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>IaaS- Infrastructure as a Service:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Infrastructure as a Service is same as purchasing or billing the utilities. With IaaS we can control the database center; compute, networking, storage on the consumption basis. It provides complete access to the networking, storage and other things to an enterprise. API or a dashboard is a way here to control all these service. By this way, an enterprise can control the services remotely, without even making a physical appearance at the datacenter. Thing that makes it opposite to SaaS and PaaS is its managing aspect. Here, for example, we can take Microsoft Azure, AWS (Amazon Web Service). With IaaS business will work on VM ware on someone else server instead of your own. This way your application will be available to anywhere your provider has a datacenter.</p>
