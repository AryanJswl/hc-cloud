<p><strong>Quantum internet breakthrough could help make hacking a thing</strong>. The advent of mass working from home has made many people more aware of the security risks of sending sensitive information via the internet. The best we can do at the moment is make it difficult to intercept and hack your messages – but we can’t make it impossible.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What we need is a new type of internet:</h2>



<p> the quantum internet. In this version of the global network, data is secure, connections are private and your worries about information being intercepted are a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Our current way of protecting online data is to encrypt it using mathematical problem that are easy to solve if you have a digital “key” to unlock the encryption but hard to solve without it. However, hard does not mean impossible and, with enough time and computer power, today’s methods of encryption can be broken.</p>



<p>Entanglement is so useful that it is set to become a resource itself, like data or electricity or water. And the primary purpose of the quantum internet is to distribute and exploit this resource in the form of entangled particles.</p>



<p>Quantum communication, on the other hand, creates keys using individual particles of light (photons) , which – according to the principles of quantum physics – are impossible to make an exact copy of. Any attempt to copy these keys will unavoidably cause errors that can be detected. This means a hacker, no matter how clever or powerful they are or what kind of supercomputer they possess, cannot replicate a quantum key or read the message it encrypts.</p>



<p>There is a catch, however. Entanglement is relatively straightforward to produce — quantum optics labs all over the world can produce it more or less on demand. But it is fragile, hard to store and tricky to transmit.</p>



<p>That’s why quantum networks are so difficult to build. Almost any outside interference destroys entanglement. Sneeze and you lose it.</p>



<p>So much of the practical work involved in creating quantum networks is in purifying, storing and boosting entanglement as it travels over long distances.</p>

<p><strong>What is State in React?</strong>&nbsp;<em>State</em>&nbsp;is a JavaScript object that stores component’s dynamic data and it enables a component to keep track of changes between renders. Because state is dynamic, it is reserved only for interactivity so you don’t use it for static React projects.</p>



<p>Components defined as classes have some additional features. Local&nbsp;<em>state</em>&nbsp;is exactly that: a feature available only to classes. S<em>tate</em>&nbsp;can only be used within a class and usually the only place where you can assign&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;is the constructor.</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br><strong>constructor()&nbsp;</strong>{<br><strong>super()</strong>;<strong>this</strong>.state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<p><strong>class</strong>&nbsp;Greeting&nbsp;<strong>extends</strong>&nbsp;React.Component {<br>state = {<br><strong>name</strong>: ‘John Smith’<br>}<br>}<br><strong>render</strong>() {<br><strong>return</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>Hello, my name is {&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>.state.<strong>name</strong>&nbsp;}<strong>&lt;/h1&gt;;</strong>}<br>}</p>



<h2 class="has-very-dark-gray-color has-text-color wp-block-heading"><strong>State Updates May Be Asynchronous</strong></h2>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>React may batch multiple&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls into a single update for performance. Calls to&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;are asynchronous when they are inside event handlers and that when you don’t rely on&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;to reflect the new value immediately after calling&nbsp;<em>setState</em>.</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br>// Note: this will *not* work as intended.<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong>count: this.state.count + 1<strong>}</strong>);<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>&nbsp;this</strong>.incrementCount();<br>// When React re-renders the component, `this.state.count` will be 1, but you expected 3.</p>



<p>// This is because `incrementCount()` function above reads from `this.state.count`,<br>// but React doesn’t update `this.state.count` until the component is re-rendered.<br>// So `incrementCount()` ends up reading `this.state.count` as 0 every time, and sets it to 1.</p>



<p>To fix it, use a second form of&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;that accepts a function rather than an object to ensure the call always uses the most updated version of&nbsp;<em>state</em>. i hope now it’s clear to you&nbsp;<strong>What is State in React?</strong></p>



<p>Passing an update function allows you to access the&nbsp;<em>current state value</em>&nbsp;inside the updater. Since&nbsp;<em>setState</em>&nbsp;calls are batched, this lets you chain updates and ensure they build on top of each other instead of conflicting:</p>



<p>incrementCount() {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; {<br>// Important: read `state` instead of `this.state` when updating.<br>return {count:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.count + 1}<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>handleSomething() {<br>// Let’s say `this.state.count` starts at 0.<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();<br><strong>this</strong>.incrementCount();</p>



<p>// If you read `this.state.count` now, it would still be 0.<br>// But when React re-renders the component, it will be 3.<br>}</p>



<p>Also you can pass&nbsp;<em>props</em>&nbsp;as a second argument at the time the update is applied:</p>



<p>// Correct<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>(state</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>props)</strong>&nbsp;=&gt; ({<br>counter:&nbsp;<strong>state</strong>.counter +&nbsp;<strong>props</strong>.increment<br>}));</p>



<p><strong>State Updates are Merged</strong></p>



<p>When you call&nbsp;setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.</p>



<p>For instance, your state may contain several independent variables:</p>



<p>constructor(<strong>props</strong>) {<br>super(<strong>props</strong>);<br><strong>this</strong>.state = {<br>posts: [],<br>comments: []<br>};<br>}</p>



<p>Then you can update them independently with separate&nbsp;setState()&nbsp;calls:</p>



<p>componentDidMount() {<br>fetchPosts().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>posts: response.posts<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});</p>



<p>fetchComments().<strong>then</strong>(response =&gt; {<br><strong>this</strong>.setState(<strong>{</strong><br>comments: response.comments<br><strong>}</strong>);<br>});<br>}</p>



<p>The merging is shallow, so&nbsp;this.setState({comments})&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;this.state.posts&nbsp;intact, but completely replaces&nbsp;this.state.comments.</p>



<p>You might be asking what is&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;and how it is used. It is a method that is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. So if you need to load data from a remote endpoint (API), this is a good place to instantiate the network request.</p>



<p><strong>What is State in React?&nbsp;</strong>As you can see in the above example the properties for&nbsp;this.state&nbsp;are now independent and separately added&nbsp;this.setState&nbsp;, passed an object to each property and surrounded them by&nbsp;ComponentDidMount()&nbsp;where they will be added to the DOM tree after we get the response from the&nbsp;fetchPosts()&nbsp;and&nbsp;fetchComments().</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">In this blog you will get a idea about what is amazon web services and their products. <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>cloud service platform</strong>, offering computing power,storage ,database and other service to help business scale and grow. Cloud provides IT resources on Internet with pay-per-price. You need not to buy any physical storage or server instead you can take it on rent at a very cheap price. There is a huge list of products offer by&nbsp;<strong>AWS&nbsp;</strong>but the major one is&nbsp;<strong>EC2</strong>, Amazon’s virtual machine service&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>S3</strong>, Amazon’s storage system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud</strong>&nbsp;<strong>EC2</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud</strong>&nbsp;<strong>EC2</strong>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<strong>web service&nbsp;</strong>that provide securable, scalable computer capacity in cloud.&nbsp;<strong>EC2&nbsp;</strong>eliminates the need to invest in hardware, So you can develop and deploy applications faster. EC2 is used to run virtual machine in cloud. AWS calls these virtual machine instances.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service S3</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Amazon Simple Storage Service S3</strong>&nbsp;provides web storage through web service interface. S3 enables customers to upload, store and download practically any file or object that is up to five terabytes (TB) in size. It is durable for objects store in service and support multiple security. To learn more about<strong>&nbsp;AWS cloud</strong>&nbsp;visit&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.easyshiksha.com/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshiksha</span></strong></a>.</p>



<p>Save costs without sacrificing performance by storing data across the&nbsp;S3 Storage Classes, which support different data access levels at corresponding rates. You can use&nbsp;S3 Storage Class Analysis&nbsp;to discover data that should move to a lower-cost storage class based on access patterns, and configure an&nbsp;S3 Lifecycle&nbsp;policy to execute the transfer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="516" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aws.jpg" alt="What are Amazon Web Services and their products ?" class="wp-image-5683" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aws.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aws-300x202.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aws-696x468.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/aws-625x420.jpg 625w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, actually one cannot decide which language is best for web development. What is best for one developer can be a crap for another web developer. It is just matter of skills set developer to have. If one developer has good skills with one language it is best for him. Development is basically based on the control over the language. To make development more beautiful one can use 2 or more different programming languages.</p>
<p>So let’s start our topic here with:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/php/" target="_blank">PHP</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP made its debut in mid-1990. It was a revolutionary application that made it possible for a website to have a dynamic data. Before this website used to be a bulk of static data but this changed it all. It made those boring website more interactive. PHP has one problem and that is a length of the code for small tasks. It requires a lot of code to make small tasks work on a website. After 2 decades there are many languages those can replace PHP. But still the PHP is ruling its place and most programmer still prefers this language.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">Java</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was never made for <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development</a></strong></span> or web applications but still, Java is said to be one of best programing language. Java had a different sole purpose, but still, get used in website development. Java is having a very long timeline so if you are into a project that will be altered by your people or other then use Java. Why? Because a basic developer knows Java well. Java’s sole purpose was never browser related development. So if you write code in Java your team will not need new to learns to make a change or maintaining code.</p>
<h3><strong>Go a.k.a. Golang:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This language is like an extension to any development language. It is flexible and easier than Java for web applications. Go is a general purpose language but not that popular. But it has an advantage when used for applications that work on parallel processing. This advantage increases its chances of being liked in future. So it will be a good option for you to do development of web application or other application.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/python/" target="_blank">Python</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Python was also not made for web development. But then Django (a python framework) made it all easy for developers. Due to this framework, a website developer can implement functionalities from python to a website. You can also use plain old Python to do application or web development.</p>
