<p>Today’s we are going to discuss&nbsp;<strong>Most Dangerous Technologies in 2020</strong>. Technology is a boon or bane it is difficult to answer. As we enter new frontiers with the latest technology trends and enjoy the many positive impacts and benefits it can have on the way we work, play and live, we must always be mindful and prepare for possible negative impacts and potential misuse of the technology. Following are the Most Dangerous Technology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drone Swarms</strong></h2>



<p>The British, Chinese, and United States armed forces are testing how interconnected, cooperative <strong>drones</strong> could be used in military operations. While this technology is still in the experimentation stage, the reality of a swarm that is smart enough to coordinate its own behaviour is moving closer to reality. To learn more about drones you can visit<strong><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/drone-technology-uses-and-applications/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"> Drones Application</span></a></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Spying Smart Home Devices</strong></h2>



<p>When you added the Echo to your room as a radio and alarm clock (or any other smart device connected to the Internet), you also allowed a spy to enter a home.&nbsp;All the information smart devices collect about your habits such as your viewing history on&nbsp;<strong>Netflix</strong>; where you live and what route you take home so Google can tell you how to avoid traffic, and all the info stored in the cloud. Of course, this information makes your life more convenient, but there is also the potential for abuse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI Cloning&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>With the support of artificial intelligence (AI), all that’s needed to create a clone of someone’s voices are just a snippet of audio. AI to create an artificial YOU and the results are so convincing our brains have trouble differentiating between what is real and what is cloned. This can be used for creating fake videos.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ransomware</strong></h2>



<p>AI and Bot-enabled Blackmailing and Hacking.When high-powered technology falls into the wrong hands, it can be very effective to achieve criminal, immoral, and malicious activities.Ransomware, where malware is used to prevent access to a computer system until a ransom is paid, is on the rise according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p>

<p>In this blog, I will discuss about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>. Imagine your computer could think like you do or even understand you? That future may not be now, but it’s one step closer, thanks to scientists and engineers and their recent discovery of a materials-based mimic for the neural signals responsible for transmitting information within the human brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus</h2>



<p>We are very closer to this reality where material that will change with temperature or an electrical stimulus. The team was able to clarify the mechanism driving this behavior by taking a new look at&nbsp;<strong>β’-CuxV2O5</strong>. A chameleon-like material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus. In the process, they zeroed in on how copper ions move around inside the material and how this subtle dance in turn sloshes electrons around to transform it.</p>



<p>Their research revealed that the movement of copper ions is the linchpin of an electrical conductivity change which can be leveraged to create electrical spikes in the same way that neurons function in the cerebral nervous system. <strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Material</h2>



<p>“Nature has given us materials with the appropriate types of behavior to mimic the information processing that occurs in a brain, but the ones characterized to date have had various limitations,”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of this work is to show that&nbsp;<strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong>&nbsp;and create electrically active materials with significantly improved neuromorphic properties. As we understand more, our materials will improve significantly, thus providing a new path to the continual technological advancement of our computing abilities.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer build a mimic</h2>



<p>A computer built to mimic the brain’s neural networks produces similar results to that of the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movement of Copper ions</h2>



<p>A very small movement of copper ions within the structure brings about a massive change in conductance in the whole material. Because of this movement of copper ions, the material transforms from insulating to conducting in response to external changes in temperature, applied voltage or applied current. There is a huge gap between the energy consumption of the brain and today’s supercomputers. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing allows us to investigate how close we can get to the energy efficiency of the brain using electronics.”</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence</strong>. IN SILICON VALLEY,&nbsp;the new currency is artificial intelligence.Over the last few years, a&nbsp;technology called deep learning&nbsp;has proven so adept at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, and translating from one language to another, the titans of Silicon Valley are eager to push the state of the art even further—and push it quickly. The two biggest players are, yes, Google and Facebook.</p>



<p>It’s a big move, because while software platforms can certain make AI research easier, more replicable, and more shareable, the whole process is nearly impossible without powerful computers.&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence.</strong> If you want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence concept visit <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">.</span></p>



<p>At Google, this tech not only helps the company&nbsp;recognize the commands you bark into your Android phone&nbsp;and&nbsp;instantly translate foreign street signs when you turn your phone their way.&nbsp;Regularly working with images or audio takes can be taxing for consumer-grade equipment, and some types of artificial intelligence have to break down and learn from 10 million pictures in order to learn from them. The process, called training, requires serious computing power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This is how the modern tech world works.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Internet’s largest services typically run on open source software. “Open source is the currency of developers now,” says Sean Stephens, the CEO of a software company called Perfect. “It’s how they share their thoughts and ideas. In the closed source world, developers don’t have a lot of room to move.” And as these services shift to&nbsp;a new breed of streamlined hardware better suited to running enormous operations, many companies are sharing their hardware designs as well.</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn about&nbsp;<strong>the top five programming languages of the world</strong>, you should start learning now.</p>



<p>Have you ever heard of python? C? C++?Java? All will say “what are you talking about? A non-programmer ever know this!” That’s true. IncludeHelp also knows that his readers have already explored a few miles on the road of C, C++, Java, and Python. Maybe still miles to go, but you all know about the languages. Below is the <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Python</strong></h2>



<p>This century loves to work with data, loves to train their machine and believes in artificial intelligence. Python is such a genuine &amp; general purpose language that helps you to explore all that you want to do. Python has been announced as the “most popular language of 2018” by&nbsp;TIOBE index. We believe the same too. Python is probably the best weapon of a geek who is working on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development of course.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Python first:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not difficult to learn</li><li>Multiple programming paradigms</li><li>Robust standard library</li><li>A nice platform for developers</li></ul>

<p>Google is amazing everyone as it makes new changes in its products. Last year Google Assistant made its appearance on wrists in Wear OS. This way they made it easy to find answers and get things completed on the go. This time they have made it more helping with some new upgrades and voice commands. Now with new updates, Google made integration of new smart suggestions in assistant. So whenever you are going to ask Google a question it will come with suggestions. Like if you ask him a question it will generate some suggestion.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="background-color: #999999; color: #ffffff;">Back to the History of</span> <span style="color: #3366ff;">W</span><span style="color: #ffcc00;">e</span><span style="color: #339966;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r</span> <span style="color: #339966;">O</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></strong></h1>
<p>But there are some people who are not aware of the Wear OS. So what is ‘<span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #3366ff;" href="https://wearos.google.com/" target="_blank">Wear OS</a></strong></span>’ or what happened to ‘Android Wear’? So the news is Google has changed its name from Android Wear to Wear OS after 4 year. They have made a separate section for that with a slogan “Make Every Minute Matter”. So nothing happened to Android Wear it just got a new name. As it works with both Android and iOS, this name suits it better.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #999999;">What is</span> <span style="color: #3366ff;">W</span><span style="color: #ffcc00;">e</span><span style="color: #339966;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r</span> <span style="color: #339966;">O</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></strong></h1>
<p>All you can say here is that it is just the new face of an old man. Google made ‘Android Wear’ just to make navigation easy. All you can do is command the watch through your voice. The watch will display up you the suggestion. But to make it more easy to control and handle they made some change. Google introduced voice output in watch and some change in assistant power and now it is ‘Wear OS’. Also, it works with Android and iOS with a little fewer features iOS.</p>
