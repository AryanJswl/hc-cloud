<p>In todays topic we will discuss&nbsp;<strong>Drone technology uses and applications.</strong> Drones also known by the name Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Miniature Pilotless Aircraft or Flying Mini&nbsp;<strong>Roborts</strong>. Over the past few years drones demand is booming in market and is used for differenet industries. From quicky deliveries at rush hour to the unreachable military basecamp drones are proving extreamly usefull in places where man cannot reach. You can also learn through my new blogs the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/how-do-drones-work/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working of drones</span></strong>&nbsp;</a>and its&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bit.ly/2Uzhsz0" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">working without GPS</span></strong></a>.</p>



<p>Initially known for military use, drones are now being used by individual enterpreneurs. According to a study by the year 2020, 16 million drones will be sold in commercial markets of the world below you can see the&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drone technology uses and applications</strong></h2>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aerial Photography</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are use to capture footage that would otherwise requires expensive choppers. No need of pilot. Easy to reach at anyplace small and compact in size which let it take magnifying pictures by getting close to the place.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shipping and Delivery</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use for fast delivery of food, small packages, medicines, beverages, letters for smaller distance. Many companies like Amazon, UPS are in favour of using drones for shot disctance delivery it will save time a lot of man power, unecessary road traffic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Disaster Management</strong></h2>



<p>Drones provide a quick report after a natural or man-made disaster geather information of injured people or the total distruction. Rescue people and provide them food, water etc.You can take a example of corona virus spread in china now they provide food and water to victams through drones.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Geographic Mapping</strong></h2>



<p>Drones can acquire very high-resolution data and download imagery in difficult to reach locations like coastlines, mountain tops, and islands. They are also used to create 3D maps and contribute to crowd sourced mapping applications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Agriculture</strong></h2>



<p>Drones use infrared sensors to detact the crop health, enable farmers to improve crop. This is a cheap and effective method for farmers to input fertilizers and pesticides.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Weather Forecast</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are also use to forecast weather it can monitore unpredictable weather, Since they are cheap and unmanned, drones can be sent into hurricanes and tornados, so that scientists and weather forecasters acquire new insights into their behavior.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Military</strong></h2>



<p>Drones are used by military for reaching terrorist campgrounds and use in war as well.</p>

<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">• Defense sector revenues likely to record 3.6 percent growth as the US defense budget returns to growth after experiencing multi-year declines</span><br />
<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">• Commercial aircraft sector’s operating profits estimated to be up 18.5 percent, whereas, </span>the defense<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> sector is expected to experience a 10.2 percent increase in operating profits.</span></p>
<h2><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">5 Trends Reshaping Aerospace and Defense Industry:</span></strong></h2>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Citizen AI:</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">AI can possibly turn into a coworker for human in <a href="https://hawkscode.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/">aerospace and defense industry</a>. Not just that it can play a central role </span>in<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> the organization. This is the thinking of not just a few but 83% of Aerospace and defense industry executives.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Extended Reality:</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">VR and AR, these are </span>the two<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> best option when it comes to eliminating the distance between people, information and machine. 96</span>%<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> of executives think that it can fill the gap between customer and employee.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Data Veracity:</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">With 80% of aerospace and defense firms increasingly using data to drive critical and automated decisions, it’s little surprise that 73% also believe that those same automated systems create new data risks including fake data, data manipulation, and i</span><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">nherent bias.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Frictionless Business:</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Not only do 64% of respondents say that the size of their ecosystem has at least doubled in the past two years, but 90% expect to be exchanging more data with these partners within two years than they do today.</span></p>
<h4><strong><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">IOT:</span></strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">93 percent of aerospace and defense executives believe that the next generation of intelligent solutions </span>is<span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;"> moving into physical environments.</span></p>

It has been a long time since the fiber transformed sports accessories in the racing car, helicopter and commercial aircraft. The aerospace industry began to move towards the entire composite plane along with carbon and glass fibers after the 1950s.</p>
<p>As a result, Boeing and Airbus have started incorporating the composite material into the part of their material to the aircraft. In order to increase safety and strength and reduce weight and fuel consumption, the aerospace industry has started using carbon composite material instead of aluminum materials.</p>
<h2><strong>Future Composites Material Graphene</strong></h2>
<p>Graphene has been introduced by Andre Geim and came into circulation in 2004 when Nobel defeated konstantin Novoselov. The Graphene of 0.345 nm atom thickness is 100 times stronger than the strongest steel. It is almost transparent and can conduct heat and electricity.</p>
<p>Graphene has the feature of high conductivity as compared to carbon which helps to protect a plane from lightning strikes. Current airplanes are also safe from the lightning strike because of including copper mesh in its wing. But replacement of copper mesh by Graphene make the plane lighter and more fuel efficient. The high conductivity of Graphene acts as a de-ice plane that reduces the equipment cost with today’s chemical de-icing technology.</p>
<p>Graphene seems to be just as revolutionary as the Carbon Fiber technology. It would be interesting to see if Carbon Fiber materials coated with graphene are used in the Aviation industry which will substantially increase the safety and also reduce the weight of the aircraft without compromising with the strength of the composite.</p>
<p>We can conclude that application of Graphene for <strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/">aerospace and defense industry</a></span></strong> as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphene has Anti-fog Crystals that helps in de-icing.</li>
<li>It can replace steel because of having lightweight and stronger.</li>
<li>Protect from the lightning strike with anti-electric shock coating.</li>
<li>Increase efficiency with lower consumption of fuel.</li>
</ul>
