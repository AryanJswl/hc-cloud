<p>Our today’s topic is&nbsp;<strong>What is Tableau?</strong>. I hope you guys have heard a lot about this tool from many people. Many people who work as Business Intelligence, Business Analyst, Data Analyst use this tool. So now the question arises in your mind Is this related to Data? or Use to organize data? Well, the answer is It helps in simplifying raw data into a very easily understandable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tableau </strong>is a powerful and rapidly growing data visualization tool used in the BI, BA and Data Analytics Industry. It make Data analysis very fast and the visualizations created are in the form of dashboards and worksheets. It even allows a non-tech person to create dashboards.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Firstly you need to understand about&nbsp;<strong>virtualization</strong></h2>



<p><strong>data virtualization&nbsp;</strong>is a pictorial representation of a given set of data. A text-based data is represented in a form of charts, tables, infographics, etc. So that new insight and hidden pattern of data can be detected and understands in a more easy way. Tableau plays a key role in Business Intelligence. I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is Tableau?</strong> and why Tableau a Powerful Tool</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are three features in tableau which help in analysing data efficiently.</h2>



<ol><li>Data Blending</li><li>Real-time analysis</li><li>collaboration of data</li></ol>



<p>Tableau was founded by Pat Hanrahan, Christian Chabot, and Chris Stolte in 2003. Tableau has a <strong>mapping functionalities </strong>which helps to plot coordinates and connect to spatial files.

<p>In this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss</strong>. In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I’ve heard it all:</p>



<ul><li>“You can’t have privacy if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have security if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t get upgrades if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have a good user experience if you use Android!”</li><li>“YOU CAN’T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!”</li></ul>



<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;</em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I’m here to tell you they’re all equally misguided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now, don’t get me wrong:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a&nbsp;<em>nugget</em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we’re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don’t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don’t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).</p>



<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself — as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform — overlooks one key point. It’s a foundational reality of Android that’s been at the system’s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches</strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app’s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</strong></p>



<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner — that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;an “Android way” — not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.</p>



<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it’s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Same level of choice and control</strong></h2>



<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world’s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.</p>



<p>It’s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story — the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choice and control within Android</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll start with privacy — an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn’t actually that it’s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It’s simply that Google’s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don’t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it — at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.</p>



<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults — and most people aren’t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What’s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide</strong>; it’s just up to you to embrace it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>What about security? Well, it’s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources —&nbsp;<em>the horror!</em>&nbsp;— but, y’know, it’s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they’ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It’s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>That brings us to the realm of updates — both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It’s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion</strong></h2>



<p>The Pixel, as I’ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It’s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company’s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be — a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn’t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it’s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>to make. There’s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone’s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities — and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Android and iOS</strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates ’em. Neither platform’s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence</strong>. IN SILICON VALLEY,&nbsp;the new currency is artificial intelligence.Over the last few years, a&nbsp;technology called deep learning&nbsp;has proven so adept at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, and translating from one language to another, the titans of Silicon Valley are eager to push the state of the art even further—and push it quickly. The two biggest players are, yes, Google and Facebook.</p>



<p>It’s a big move, because while software platforms can certain make AI research easier, more replicable, and more shareable, the whole process is nearly impossible without powerful computers.&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence.</strong> If you want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence concept visit <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">.</span></p>



<p>At Google, this tech not only helps the company&nbsp;recognize the commands you bark into your Android phone&nbsp;and&nbsp;instantly translate foreign street signs when you turn your phone their way.&nbsp;Regularly working with images or audio takes can be taxing for consumer-grade equipment, and some types of artificial intelligence have to break down and learn from 10 million pictures in order to learn from them. The process, called training, requires serious computing power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This is how the modern tech world works.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Internet’s largest services typically run on open source software. “Open source is the currency of developers now,” says Sean Stephens, the CEO of a software company called Perfect. “It’s how they share their thoughts and ideas. In the closed source world, developers don’t have a lot of room to move.” And as these services shift to&nbsp;a new breed of streamlined hardware better suited to running enormous operations, many companies are sharing their hardware designs as well.</p>

<p><strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.&nbsp;</strong>Network troubleshooting tools are a necessity for every network administrator. When getting started in the networking field, it is important to amass a number of tools that can be used to troubleshoot a variety of different network conditions.</p>



<p>While it is true that the the use of specific tools can be subjective and at the discretion of the engineer, the selection of tools in this article has been made based on their generality and common use. </p>



<p>Following are the <strong>Basics tools that can help you troubleshoot most networking issues.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ping</strong></h2>



<p>The most commonly used network tool is the ping utility. This utility is used to provide a basic connectivity test between the requesting host and a destination host. This is done by using the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) which has the ability to send an echo packet to a destination host and a mechanism to listen for a response from this host. Simply stated, if the requesting host receives a response from the destination host, this host is reachable.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracert/traceroute</strong></h2>



<p>Typically, once the ping utility has been used to determine basic connectivity, the tracert/traceroute utility can used to determine more specific information about the path to the destination host including the route the packet takes and the response time of these intermediate hosts. The tracert utility and traceroute utilities perform the same function but operate on different operating systems, Tracert for Windows machines and traceroute for Linux/*nix based machines.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ipconfig/ifconfig</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most important things that must be completed when troubleshooting a networking issue is to find out the specific IP configuration of the variously affected hosts. Sometimes this information is already known when addressing is configured statically, but when a dynamic addressing method is used, the IP address of each host can potentially change often.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nslookup</strong></h2>



<p>networking issues revolve around issues with Dynamic Name System (DNS) address resolution issues. DNS is used by everyone using the Internet to resolve commonly known domain names (i.e. google.com) to commonly unknown IP addresses (i.e. 74.125.115.147). When this system does not work, most of the functionality that people are used to goes away, as there is no way to resolve this information. The nslookup utility can be used to lookup the specific IP address(es) associated with a domain name. If this utility is unable to resolve this information, there is a DNS issue. Along with simple lookup, the nslookup utility is able to query specific DNS servers to determine an issue with the default DNS servers configured on a host.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DNS Lookup</strong></h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>DNS Lookup</strong>&nbsp;tool retrieves domain name records for the domain name that you provide. You can use this to help diagnose problems and see if the problem originates from the domain name server — if you cannot return a domain’s records, you’ll know where to begin troubleshooting!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Email Checker</strong>&nbsp;allows you to test the validity and reachability of an email address. It makes sure that the email is syntactically valid and that it is available via an SMTP server. If you’re trying to cull false email addresses from your email list or something similar, this tool will be helpful.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HTTP Headers</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-5712" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The HTTP Headers tool allows you to see what headers are returned by a web server for a specific domain name or IP Address. If you notice odd behavior with your HTTP connections, you can use this tool to troubleshoot the top-level domain. Alternatively, you can use it to check for redirection — minimizing these optimizes any links you might be using.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>URL Encode Decode</strong></h2>



<p>If you need to include special characters in your URL, you’ll need to encode them so that the URL remains valid. You can do this with&nbsp;<strong>URL Encode</strong>. Conversely, if a URL contains special characters and has been encoded, yet you want to see it in a more human-readable form, use&nbsp;<strong>URL Decode</strong>&nbsp;to standardize the URL.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>WHO IS  Search</strong></h2>



<p>If you are curious as to who the responsible party (or parties) is behind a domain name, the <strong>WHOIS query</strong> will allow you to query multiple domain registrars’ databases. If the owner has chosen to hide their information, you can nevertheless return forwarding information.</p>

<p>As we all know that all the globe is in Lockdown due to novel coronavirus, the pandemic. Most of the public sector and private services are in Lockdown and if you think information technology is free from it then You are wrong……</p>



<p>Most of the top companies in the <strong>IT (Information Technology)</strong> sector including <strong><a href="http://www.hawkscode.com">HawksCode</a></strong>, <strong>Infosys</strong>, <strong>Wipro</strong>, <strong>TCS</strong> and many more were gone under lockdown for the last few months and still don&#8217;t know the future.</p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>&#8220;THE IT SECTOR IS THE BIGGEST ECONOMIC BONE OF ANY COUNTRY&#8221;</em></strong></p>



<p><strong><em>The economy </em></strong>is the most dangerous issue in the world during covid_19 and for cop-up with this most of the IT, firms decided to apply for <strong>work from home on their employees</strong>. </p>



<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>But now the question is what type of technology we use amid covid_19.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Technology plays an important role in the world and now in the time of lockdown, its role is more important. We have discussed some points on how to use technology during lockdown especially in the <strong>Information Technology</strong> sector. </p>



<ol><li><strong>Use Skype &#8211; </strong>Skype is one of the best ways to be in touch with your clients and employees during the lockdown, one can communicate with others and share all the information and details with one another.</li><li><strong>Zoom &#8211; </strong>Zoom is another platform where one can conduct video conference or so-called <strong>webinar</strong> for meetings and conferences. </li><li><strong>Google Drive &#8211; </strong>Google drive is one of the best ways to share your data with others, it is the free source provided by Google. </li><li><strong>Artificial Intelligence  (AI) &#8211; </strong>This New Technology is the best way to deal with work without human efforts. Many devices nowadays are accessible to most of our efforts.. Few examples like Alexa, Google voice, eco, etc.. </li><li><strong>Cloud Computing &#8211; </strong>It&#8217;s the old trend now to save all the data in files and brochures, now most of the data have been stored in cloud only. It is the best way to store data and one can access the data from anywhere in the world.</li><li>Broadcast &#8211; broadcast is the fastest way to share the details and data with the employees, so in mid of lockdown, the broadcast will play an important role. </li></ol>



<p><strong>Coronavirus</strong> is the most dangerous pandemic in the world now., it is spread already across the globe and economy is affected by it. So the information technology sector plays an important role.</p>

Data is the Biggest asset of individuals and organizations today. It is more precious than Land and Gold. The importance of data is a well known universal fact, even after that, Personal Data is the most ignored possession among people in developing countries. In this article, we are going to discuss the vital need of Data privacy and implementation of Data protection legal framework.</span></span></p>

Data Privacy refers to the ability to regulate the processing of your data. Your data is private if you and only you can decide the harnessing of your information. Concluding the above, we can say that Data Privacy is a condition where the owner decides the sharing limits of his Data.</span></span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: large;"><b>The Growing Need for Data Privacy </b></span></span></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Data Protection is not only the concern of individuals of any particular class of the society. It also not belongs to a particular business type or Industry. Both the individuals as well as organizations are the stakeholders of Data Privacy. For Example, a company can have the sensitive data of millions of customers. Similarly, an individual can have personal information like financial data, including bank account and credit card numbers, health and medical records, and even basic, but still personalised sensitive info, such as full names, addresses and birthdates. So, Data privacy is a concern of both Individuals as well as Organization. As an individual, no one wants to share his credit card details by the Bank to third parties. The Personal Identification Number of a person contains all his personal information even biometrics. so protecting it from the unreliable sources becomes the vital need.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">There should be a healthy relationship between the Data Principals (whose Data is collected) and the Data fiduciaries (those who process the Data ). The absence of a lawful contract between these two may lead to Data Breach. Data Breach is a condition of sharing of secure and private data with third parties, who may be unfaithful. Recently, Facebook was accused of sharing its user’s data with a third party Cambridge Analytica. They used the personal data of users to affect the General elections in the USA. Similarly, some companies collect the sensitive data of their customers and sell them for market research purposes. The Personal data, which you are ignoring act as a fuel in Business in the age of Data-Driven Marketing. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In India, a hot debate is going on the Privacy of Aadhar Details collected by UIDAI. The Supreme Court of India has also issued a lot of Sensitive Guidelines over Collection of Data and Harnessing it. Recently, Reserve Bank of India has ordered Bharti Airtel and Paytm to stop doing eKYC of its users</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So, we can conclude that access of unlawful bodies to the private data may be hazardous for </span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">the data owner in many numbers of ways. Hence, a Data Privacy Legal framework is the essential requirement of society. A regulatory Body should exist in every country which can monitor the harnessing of Data and its Collection.</span></span></p>
