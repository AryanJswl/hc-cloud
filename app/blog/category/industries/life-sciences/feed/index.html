<p>In this blog, I will discuss about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>. Imagine your computer could think like you do or even understand you? That future may not be now, but it’s one step closer, thanks to scientists and engineers and their recent discovery of a materials-based mimic for the neural signals responsible for transmitting information within the human brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus</h2>



<p>We are very closer to this reality where material that will change with temperature or an electrical stimulus. The team was able to clarify the mechanism driving this behavior by taking a new look at&nbsp;<strong>β’-CuxV2O5</strong>. A chameleon-like material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus. In the process, they zeroed in on how copper ions move around inside the material and how this subtle dance in turn sloshes electrons around to transform it.</p>



<p>Their research revealed that the movement of copper ions is the linchpin of an electrical conductivity change which can be leveraged to create electrical spikes in the same way that neurons function in the cerebral nervous system. <strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Material</h2>



<p>“Nature has given us materials with the appropriate types of behavior to mimic the information processing that occurs in a brain, but the ones characterized to date have had various limitations,”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of this work is to show that&nbsp;<strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong>&nbsp;and create electrically active materials with significantly improved neuromorphic properties. As we understand more, our materials will improve significantly, thus providing a new path to the continual technological advancement of our computing abilities.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer build a mimic</h2>



<p>A computer built to mimic the brain’s neural networks produces similar results to that of the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movement of Copper ions</h2>



<p>A very small movement of copper ions within the structure brings about a massive change in conductance in the whole material. Because of this movement of copper ions, the material transforms from insulating to conducting in response to external changes in temperature, applied voltage or applied current. There is a huge gap between the energy consumption of the brain and today’s supercomputers. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing allows us to investigate how close we can get to the energy efficiency of the brain using electronics.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Machine-Learning1.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4733" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Machine-Learning1.png" alt="Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Nvidia" width="800" height="491" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This application of the Artificial Intelligence can be used from small pace to the big pace. This require system to be that able to analyze all the data and make right decisions. Here human will not make any interaction to manually feed the machine with a decision. It will learn by itself. For example, we can take our daily life example of machine learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-driving car project.</li>
<li>Online Suggestion of products by Application and Browsers.</li>
<li>Fraud and Spam Detection.</li>
</ul>
<p>“A machine learning is the process when a system is taught to learn by itself with the analysis of the data and information fetched while being used.”</p>
<h5>Nvidia on Machine Learning-</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Machine Learning at its most basic is the practice of using algorithms to parse data, learn from it, and then make a determination or prediction about something in the world.&#8221;</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">They also have said that it is an idea that came from the mind of AI makers. They worked on the algorithms and decision tree learning. This vision has the best area of work that is computer systems. But still, they need some hand-code to make the system learn things. It is like teaching alphabets to the system first and then let it learn how to read by itself.</p>
<h5>The University of Washington-</h5>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">&#8220;Machine learning (a.k.a. data mining or predictive analytics) will be the driver of the next big wave of innovation.&#8221;</h5>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also said that every year there are many algorithms are released by many people. All you have to do here is that finding the right one for you. Analyze what is your system is here for and what it lacks in doing. All you need to do here now is getting the suitable algorithms for this otherwise you will get lost in this very big space of machine learning.</p>
<h4>What makes it different from AI?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Machine Learning is just an <a href="https://hawkscode.com/industries/internet-of-things/">application of Artificial Intelligence</a>. It just a way to achieve AI. Still, you can achieve AI but you will have to work so hard. You need to make decision tree and complex algorithms those will only increase the number of lines in the source code. Machine learning like teaching an algorithm “how”. How the thing gets done, how to use a particular set of data. “Learning” here is resembling that the algorithm will feed on the data and will modify itself. It is like tagging your friend in million of photos then the one-day website will automatically grab the tag. How did that happen? This happened because machine keeps grabbing your data and learned how he looks. So now as you uploaded another picture.</p>
