From those factors, one was business growth. 40% of the CEO or leaders are majorly focused on the business growth. Hiring employees with simple means of increasing productivity with undertaking digital transformation. Digital transformation is one way to make changes and upgrades in the structure of the company. This practice is upskilling the business and its entity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AI, Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics, these three elements of fourth industrial revolution has made businesses to undergo some changes. These changes are the first key to unlock door towards the transformation of culture. To be competitive in the market business must implement new emerging technology into their culture. Transformation is necessary and you can&#8217;t implement it in just snap of fingers. This slow process will keep you ahead of your competitors. Through these programs, CEOs reported achieving the ideal balance of skill upgradation, work-culture transformation and overall business optimization.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CIO and CEO with Digital Transformation for Business:</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Be a Leader:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to business, many CEOs see their business as an innovation pioneer. Here CIOs come into the role by encouraging their CEOs to invest more in R&amp;D. CIOs want their company to adopt digitization and make their products more innovative. The desire of being seen is making CIOs leaders in many areas of the company decisions. Even mergers, partnerships are also treated as ‘surgical integration’. Their faith is now more on employee’s experience because their experience helps in attaining comprehensive leadership.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Discuss the Budget:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital abilities are now taking over the center stage and that need all CEO’s to think like CIOs. This is crucial in a matter of budget allocation, resources acquisition. Digitization has played important role in growing businesses and keeping them ahead. However, a CEO must verify and do some digging about the technology they are about to implement in their business. So before undergoing any significant transformation CEO must do some practices. These are like, evaluation of financial impact, in-depth research of business need and values addition toward business.</p>

Many people who have invested in it have no clue why it is happening? It again dropped by 12% today. If we take a look at its performance it fell 50% all alone this year. This fall happened when Korean Bitcoin Exchange Coinrail warned their investors of the hack attempt. People who are not looking at Bitcoin may be smiling or grinning after a while. From its all-time high $19,000 bitcoin is now floating around $6,785 as by ‘Coindesk’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Ethereum and Ripple are falling down. Today they are 10% down too. Crypto-marketers are happy this year as major <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #008000;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://cryptoloins.com/" target="_blank">Cryptocurrency</a></span></strong></span> as falling. This same time last year when Bitcoin was hanging near $3000, were not founding the ground. It is a time for hope for those who were holding coins when it was up. Coinrail has its name in the top 100 bitcoin exchanges in the world. It exchanges some 50 cryptocurrencies. This hack is another big heist in the Bitcoin history. This raises the fear of people regarding Cryptocurrency’s security and investment.</p>

<p>The Coinrail in a statement, “Their system was hit with a ‘cyber-intrusion’ on Sunday. This caused the loss of 30% of coins in the exchange.” The value is quantified but a local news channel made some calculation. According to that stolen coins are worth of $32.77M. This heist took place in just an hour. Due to this heist Bitcoin made a fall of $500 and currently wondering at $6,627.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">South Korea has been the biggest market of the cryptocurrency market. Bithumb, World’s Fifth Crpyto-exchange, was hacked in July last year. This was also a big event that questioned the safety of the investment. But still, numbers of the investors is not stopping. Still, some of the buyers have enough money to play around but a little low. In a recent event, Coindesk generated a graph that showcased danger of investing into the cryptocurrency into this stretched time of risk.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Coinrail shared some words. “70% of the total coin and token reserves have been confirmed to be safely stored and moved to a cold wallet [not connected to the internet]. Two-thirds of stolen cryptocurrencies were withdrawn or frozen in partnership with related exchanges and coin companies. For the rest, we are looking into it with an investigative agency, related exchanges and coin developers.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cryptocurrency may have recovered some time by few ups but it is falling for a long time. This much fall happened in all over the March month. Also, it is not able to sustain its value and it doesn’t look like it will soon enough. Not just sustaining, markets believe that it will be this volatile because of low trading volume. Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and other might have fallen but there were some who were doing some good. Ontology and 0x are those two cryptocurrencies who performed well in this bad time. Other cryptocurrencies have shown same rise and fall in their prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bitcoin showed a rise on March 28 and reached $8,200 but this doesn’t last long. This fall after a few time to $7,750 but at market roundup, it jumped back to $7,850. It may look like that it will reach to $9,000 but that will only happen when there is a spike in buy volume. Binance CEO specified that they received a letter from Japanese Financial Service Agency (FSA). He explained about this letter in his words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We received a simple letter from JFSA about an hour ago. Our lawyers called JFSA immediately and will find a solution. Protecting user interests is our top priority. No need to worry. Some negative news often turns out to be positive in the long term. Chinese have a proverb for this. New (often better) opportunities always emerge during times of change,”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This letter made it look like that the market fell was due to the Binance. But if Binance has the power to make market fall then it can also raise it. Cryptocurrency is still falling and 97% of world population is still figuring out whether to buy or not. And with 3% of the population, it is hard to rise again. Because the price of cryptocurrencies depends on the buy and sell-volume of the market.</p>
