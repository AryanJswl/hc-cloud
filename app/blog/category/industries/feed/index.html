<p>Our today’s topic is&nbsp;<strong>What is Tableau?</strong>. I hope you guys have heard a lot about this tool from many people. Many people who work as Business Intelligence, Business Analyst, Data Analyst use this tool. So now the question arises in your mind Is this related to Data? or Use to organize data? Well, the answer is It helps in simplifying raw data into a very easily understandable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tableau </strong>is a powerful and rapidly growing data visualization tool used in the BI, BA and Data Analytics Industry. It make Data analysis very fast and the visualizations created are in the form of dashboards and worksheets. It even allows a non-tech person to create dashboards. Learn courses online on&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="color:#2919de" class="has-inline-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span style="color:#361ce2" class="has-inline-color">.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Firstly you need to understand about&nbsp;<strong>virtualization</strong></h2>



<p><strong>data virtualization&nbsp;</strong>is a pictorial representation of a given set of data. A text-based data is represented in a form of charts, tables, infographics, etc. So that new insight and hidden pattern of data can be detected and understands in a more easy way. Tableau plays a key role in Business Intelligence. I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is Tableau?</strong> and why Tableau a Powerful Tool</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are three features in tableau which help in analysing data efficiently.</h2>



<ol><li>Data Blending</li><li>Real-time analysis</li><li>collaboration of data</li></ol>



<p>Tableau was founded by Pat Hanrahan, Christian Chabot, and Chris Stolte in 2003. Tableau has a <strong>mapping functionalities </strong>which helps to plot coordinates and connect to spatial files. Tableau become popular because of its easy drag-and-drop functionality, it is faster than other BI tools, high scalability as it adapts to the individual as well as enterprise needs easily, it has mobile compatibility, connectivity to a huge number of data sources without needing to buy connector license,<strong><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/big-data-a-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="color:#3425db" class="has-inline-color">big data</span></a></strong>&nbsp;analytics capabilities etc.</p>

<p>Today’s we are going to discuss&nbsp;<strong>Most Dangerous Technologies in 2020</strong>. Technology is a boon or bane it is difficult to answer. As we enter new frontiers with the latest technology trends and enjoy the many positive impacts and benefits it can have on the way we work, play and live, we must always be mindful and prepare for possible negative impacts and potential misuse of the technology. Following are the Most Dangerous Technology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drone Swarms</strong></h2>



<p>The British, Chinese, and United States armed forces are testing how interconnected, cooperative <strong>drones</strong> could be used in military operations. While this technology is still in the experimentation stage, the reality of a swarm that is smart enough to coordinate its own behaviour is moving closer to reality. To learn more about drones you can visit<strong><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/drone-technology-uses-and-applications/"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"> Drones Application</span></a></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Spying Smart Home Devices</strong></h2>



<p>When you added the Echo to your room as a radio and alarm clock (or any other smart device connected to the Internet), you also allowed a spy to enter a home.&nbsp;All the information smart devices collect about your habits such as your viewing history on&nbsp;<strong>Netflix</strong>; where you live and what route you take home so Google can tell you how to avoid traffic, and all the info stored in the cloud. Of course, this information makes your life more convenient, but there is also the potential for abuse.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI Cloning&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>With the support of artificial intelligence (AI), all that’s needed to create a clone of someone’s voices are just a snippet of audio. AI to create an artificial YOU and the results are so convincing our brains have trouble differentiating between what is real and what is cloned. This can be used for creating fake videos.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ransomware</strong></h2>



<p>AI and Bot-enabled Blackmailing and Hacking.When high-powered technology falls into the wrong hands, it can be very effective to achieve criminal, immoral, and malicious activities.Ransomware, where malware is used to prevent access to a computer system until a ransom is paid, is on the rise according to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p>

<p>In this blog, <strong>The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss</strong>. In my approximately 97 years of covering Android, I’ve heard it all:</p>



<ul><li>“You can’t have privacy if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have security if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t get upgrades if you use Android!”</li><li>“You can’t have a good user experience if you use Android!”</li><li>“YOU CAN’T BE ONE OF THE COOL KIDS IF YOU USE ANDROID!”</li></ul>



<p>All right, so that last one might be a&nbsp;<em>bit&nbsp;</em>of an exaggeration (though only a little). But that aside, these are all shockingly common sentiments you hear not only from tech enthusiasts but also from people who write about this stuff for a living. And I’m here to tell you they’re all equally misguided.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Now, don’t get me wrong:</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a&nbsp;<em>nugget</em>&nbsp;of truth to every one of those statements (even the last one; hey, we’re all proud nerds here, right?). Lots of folks using Android genuinely don’t have the most optimal privacy scenario or the most secure setup imaginable on their phones. A depressingly high number of Android phone-owners don’t get timely and reliable software updates. And, yes, a huge amount of Android users have horrible user experiences (whether they actively realize it or not).</p>



<p>But treating all of those issues as blanket condemnations of Android itself — as inherent and unavoidable flaws with the platform — overlooks one key point. It’s a foundational reality of Android that’s been at the system’s core since the start, and keeping it front of mind changes the entire view of what Android represents.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The best way to sum it up is with two complementary words</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Choice and control: Two platforms, two approaches</strong> for people accustomed to the Apple universe, the notion of choice and control within a smartphone environment can be a funny concept to grasp. When you buy an iPhone, for better or sometimes for worse, you get The Apple Way the Apple way of balancing privacy with function, the Apple way of providing Apple-controlled software updates to Apple-made devices, the Apple way of forcing you to see a static grid of all your app’s icons on your home screen all the time, and the Apple way of having to use Apple apps as your default browser, email service, mapping service, and so on.&nbsp;T<strong>he key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</strong></p>



<p>And so when people who are accustomed to that sort of approach think about Android, they frequently assume Android operates in a similar manner — that whatever they read about or see on, say, a Samsung phone is The Android Way. The problem is that there&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em>&nbsp;an “Android way” — not in any Apple-esque, platform-wide level.</p>



<p> Sometimes, that choice and control lands in the hands of you, the user. Other times, it’s in the arms of the company that made the device. Either way, just like in the Apple universe, the result is a mix of positives and negatives.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Same level of choice and control</strong></h2>



<p>Critically, that same level of choice and control is a huge part of what allowed Android to catch on initially and then grow into its position as the world’s most widely used operating system. In the early days of Android, it was the fact that phone-makers and carriers alike could bring their own unique flavors and business interests into the software that convinced so many players to sign on. And still today, that flexibility is a powerful part of what makes Android appealing to companies like Samsung, which want to push their own&nbsp;profit-turning services&nbsp;and to handle software the way they see fit just as much as they want to hawk hardware.</p>



<p>It’s a mix of pros and cons, particularly from the perspective of someone who actually uses these products. But that brings us back to the statements we went over at the start of this story — the misleading generalities about areas like privacy, security, upgrades, and user experience on Android.The key point most Android vs iOS arguments miss.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choice and control within Android</strong></h2>



<p>We’ll start with privacy — an area where Apple&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>likes to act superior (at least,&nbsp;when the narrative fits). But despite what the casual sweater-wearing executives on stages keep saying, the reality isn’t actually that it’s impossible to have dialed-up privacy on Android. It’s simply that Google’s business model and the services Google provides rely upon the responsible use of a certain amount of data in order to operate. And if you don’t want your data used in that way, you can make an educated decision to change it — at a certain cost, of course, when it comes to functionality.</p>



<p>Now, the flip side is that most Android privacy matters operate via a system of defaults — and most people aren’t gonna take the time to navigate the labyrinth of related settings. What’s more, most people would probably pick the functionality they get as a result of their data being used over the lower-functionality, higher-privacy alternative, anyway. But the choice is there, as I lay out in my new&nbsp;<strong>Android privacy guide</strong>; it’s just up to you to embrace it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Security Concerns</strong></h2>



<p>What about security? Well, it’s true that Android does allow you to install apps from external sources —&nbsp;<em>the horror!</em>&nbsp;— but, y’know, it’s also a choice. Most typical phone-owners will never wander into a shady-looking forum in some dusty corner of the web and download an app posted by a guy named Ned. Even if they&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;attempt to do that, they’ll have to go through multiple layers of warnings and overrides before their phone will let them. And still then, their system&nbsp;will scan the file&nbsp;to look for any known issues and identify any red flags. It’s essentially an enhanced and significantly lower-risk version of the same thing you get when using a regular computer. And just like in that environment,&nbsp;a little common sense goes a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>That brings us to the realm of updates — both OS-level and the monthly security patch complements (both of which&nbsp;are equally important&nbsp;when it comes to optimal privacy and security protection, by the way). It’s true that most Android device-makers do&nbsp;an embarrassingly bad job&nbsp;at providing software updates to their devices and that you as the user are the one who suffers from that negligence, even with the way Google has made OS updates themselves&nbsp;less all-important&nbsp;on Android than they are on iOS. We&nbsp;talk about that constantly&nbsp;in these quarters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>And that leads us to the biggest point of all in this discussion</strong></h2>



<p>The Pixel, as I’ve put it before, is essentially the closest thing to an iPhone-like equivalent within the Android world. It’s a device made by the company responsible for the operating system; supported directly by that same company, with no middlemen or mitigating forces involved; and with an unmeddled version of that company’s widely lauded vision for what the user experience should be — a vision that eschews confusing redundant apps competing for your attention and creates an ecosystem-wide consistency in design.&nbsp;The key point most Android vs iOS arguments.</p>



<p>Unlike with iOS, though, on Android, that isn’t the only choice. You can have it if you want it, but it’s a decision for&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>to make. There’s no shortage of diversity within the platform, and if you find another phone’s size, style, or stamina to be more appealing, you can have that, too. It ultimately just comes down to a matter of priorities — and a matter of educating yourself about the possibilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Android and iOS</strong>&nbsp;have grown&nbsp;increasingly similar&nbsp;over the years, but the foundational difference of choice and control continues to be a significant factor that separates ’em. Neither platform’s approach is inherently better, but they&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;strikingly different. And the sooner we can all internalize that, the sooner we can stop having silly discussions that revolve around an inaccurate assumption.</p>

<p><strong>AI based Video Analytics Making Supply Chains Smarter</strong>. The growing use of <a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School"><strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong></a>-powered video analytics over the years has radically altered and improved the operations of many processes, across industries and continents. The findings of the IHS Markit Video Surveillance Intelligence Service shows that there has been a consistent growth in the global professional video surveillance equipment market, with the worldwide market revenue jumping up from $18.2 billion in 2024 to $19.9 billion in 2019.</p>



<p>Moreover, the use of video is becoming vital for businesses to ensure better management of their inventory. There are often instances of damage, theft or pilferage of goods, either when they are in the warehouse or in transit. To overcome these challenges, CCTV cameras backed with video analytics are being employed, which can efficiently and instantly track and detect any kind of suspicious activity and further send alerts to the server over the network. The supply chain managers are then able to take prompt action to ensure uninterrupted supply of the products.</p>



<p>At present, when COVID-19 has brought about ripples of turbulence for almost all businesses, requiring them to practice and adopt enhanced safety measures, video analytics has truly been playing a quintessential role by ensuring that all safety precautions are being duly undertaken to limit the spread of infection. The CCTV cameras equipped with video analytics are able to closely monitor the movement of people, making sure that social distancing norms are strictly followed and face masks are mandatorily used. In case of any violation of any of these norms, the system automatically triggers alerts, which allows for appropriate action to be taken.</p>



<p>Further, while during road transport, when goods are transported in bulk from one place to another, the use of video analytics makes it possible for businesses to analyse the truck utilization patterns on a daily basis and gain a view of loading/unloading activity details, load per cent capacity, etc. This aids the supply chain managers to keep a check on the overall productivity of their fleet, and make changes whenever necessary. Also, there are other KPIs like facial recognition, driver wellness, etc., that can be efficiently monitored to ensure control and optimization of the supply chain.</p>



<p>Needless to say, advances in technology have paved the way for many exciting opportunities for businesses. Besides bringing in visibility and transparency, video analytics has proved extremely helpful in ensuring safety, quality, timeliness, performance and productivity for businesses. By seamlessly integrating with the existing video infrastructure, the technology has been successful in increasing the supply chain efficiency, eventually translating into increased customer satisfaction and improved business profits.&nbsp; Isn’t this disruptive? Yes, it certainly is!</p>

<p>In this blog, I will discuss about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>. Imagine your computer could think like you do or even understand you? That future may not be now, but it’s one step closer, thanks to scientists and engineers and their recent discovery of a materials-based mimic for the neural signals responsible for transmitting information within the human brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus</h2>



<p>We are very closer to this reality where material that will change with temperature or an electrical stimulus. The team was able to clarify the mechanism driving this behavior by taking a new look at&nbsp;<strong>β’-CuxV2O5</strong>. A chameleon-like material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus. In the process, they zeroed in on how copper ions move around inside the material and how this subtle dance in turn sloshes electrons around to transform it.</p>



<p>Their research revealed that the movement of copper ions is the linchpin of an electrical conductivity change which can be leveraged to create electrical spikes in the same way that neurons function in the cerebral nervous system. <strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Material</h2>



<p>“Nature has given us materials with the appropriate types of behavior to mimic the information processing that occurs in a brain, but the ones characterized to date have had various limitations,”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of this work is to show that&nbsp;<strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong>&nbsp;and create electrically active materials with significantly improved neuromorphic properties. As we understand more, our materials will improve significantly, thus providing a new path to the continual technological advancement of our computing abilities.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer build a mimic</h2>



<p>A computer built to mimic the brain’s neural networks produces similar results to that of the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movement of Copper ions</h2>



<p>A very small movement of copper ions within the structure brings about a massive change in conductance in the whole material. Because of this movement of copper ions, the material transforms from insulating to conducting in response to external changes in temperature, applied voltage or applied current. There is a huge gap between the energy consumption of the brain and today’s supercomputers. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing allows us to investigate how close we can get to the energy efficiency of the brain using electronics.”</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence</strong>. IN SILICON VALLEY,&nbsp;the new currency is artificial intelligence.Over the last few years, a&nbsp;technology called deep learning&nbsp;has proven so adept at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, and translating from one language to another, the titans of Silicon Valley are eager to push the state of the art even further—and push it quickly. The two biggest players are, yes, Google and Facebook.</p>



<p>It’s a big move, because while software platforms can certain make AI research easier, more replicable, and more shareable, the whole process is nearly impossible without powerful computers.&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence.</strong> If you want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence concept visit <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">.</span></p>



<p>At Google, this tech not only helps the company&nbsp;recognize the commands you bark into your Android phone&nbsp;and&nbsp;instantly translate foreign street signs when you turn your phone their way.&nbsp;Regularly working with images or audio takes can be taxing for consumer-grade equipment, and some types of artificial intelligence have to break down and learn from 10 million pictures in order to learn from them. The process, called training, requires serious computing power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This is how the modern tech world works.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Internet’s largest services typically run on open source software. “Open source is the currency of developers now,” says Sean Stephens, the CEO of a software company called Perfect. “It’s how they share their thoughts and ideas. In the closed source world, developers don’t have a lot of room to move.” And as these services shift to&nbsp;a new breed of streamlined hardware better suited to running enormous operations, many companies are sharing their hardware designs as well.</p>
