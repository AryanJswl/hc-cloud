It do not matter whether for social movement, information spreader, entertainment and business. Yes business, many companies are using it as a major marketing feature for their products. Now it depends on you and product to choose right media for promotion. Not just social media, we can also include messanging applications like WhatsApp too. These apps and sites are marketers first choice in spreading their words.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instagram Micro Influencers for Social Media Marketing:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5123" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2.jpg" alt="Social Media, Marketing, WhatsApp, Instagram" width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Instagram is one these major social promotional site. If your business marketing include visuals to attract people then Instagram is best place to practice marketing. Insta have 800 million monthly active users and 95 million media is posted every day. If we see from the business perspective then there are 25 million business profile. Most of these businesses are related to the travelling, fashion, photography, movies or visuals and Foods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Insta business people use micro-influencers to promote their product. Micro-influencers are people with 1,000-10,000 followers. Here main focus is not into making followers but making impression on people. But what about people with large number of followers? There is a study that showed micro-influencers have great engagement than celebrity. So for promotional purpose you don’t have to pay big money to celebs. Go to micro-influencers, pay a little and in return you will get a lot. So that means your ROI will always look good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A micro-influencer allows the brand to create additional content that supports the brand. It is also perceived as an endorsement of the brand by many potential buyers. And a large percentage of people trust influencers and online reviews as much as they would trust a friend&#8217;s advice.” says David Abehsera, President and Co-founder of The Woo.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tips on Using WhatsApp Another Handy Tool for Business</strong></h2>

They explained the feature by saying that Whatsapp is changing its behaviour. At first, WhatsApp used to delete media file like image video from their server as user downloads it. Now if the user accidentally deletes the media then it can not we restored or redownload again. But now they have come with a new plan to keep the media on the server. Now user can recover deleted media even after they have deleted data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This media used to get stored on the server for 30 days till the day user will download them. As user download them it will immediately get deleted from the server. Just after downloading media if it gets deleted accidentally you cannot download them again. But now Whatsapp will hold them on their server.</p>
<h4><strong><span style="background-color: #ff0000; color: #ffffff;">Caution: This feature cannot retrieve the message once they are deleted. So do not try this.</span></strong></h4>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #26d466; color: #ffffff;"><strong>No Interference in Voice Chat:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whatsapp-Voice-Updates.png"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4857" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whatsapp-Voice-Updates.png" alt="whatsapp, Update, group, voice chat, video chat" width="1276" height="325" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whatsapp-Voice-Updates.png 1276w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whatsapp-Voice-Updates-300x76.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whatsapp-Voice-Updates-1024x261.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whatsapp-Voice-Updates-696x177.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Whatsapp-Voice-Updates-1068x272.png 1068w" sizes="(max-width: 1276px) 100vw, 1276px" /></a>Another update that everyone was needed was this frustrating voice interference feature. If you too much rely on voice chat feature of application then this is for you. Before this update, if you are listening to a voice message and get interrupted then if you listen to that message again it will start from the beginning. What if the message was 5 min long and you know that you can use timeline here. So WhatsApp added this feature. It will now remember where you left the message and will resume from same as you come back.</p>
