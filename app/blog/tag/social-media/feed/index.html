Now it depends on you and product to choose right media for promotion. Not just social media, we can also include messanging applications like WhatsApp too. These apps and sites are marketers first choice in spreading their words.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Instagram Micro Influencers for Social Media Marketing:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5123" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2.jpg" alt="Social Media, Marketing, WhatsApp, Instagram" width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Social-Media-Marketing-WhatsApp-Instagram-2-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Instagram is one these major social promotional site. If your business marketing include visuals to attract people then Instagram is best place to practice marketing. Insta have 800 million monthly active users and 95 million media is posted every day. If we see from the business perspective then there are 25 million business profile. Most of these businesses are related to the travelling, fashion, photography, movies or visuals and Foods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Insta business people use micro-influencers to promote their product. Micro-influencers are people with 1,000-10,000 followers. Here main focus is not into making followers but making impression on people. But what about people with large number of followers? There is a study that showed micro-influencers have great engagement than celebrity. So for promotional purpose you don’t have to pay big money to celebs. Go to micro-influencers, pay a little and in return you will get a lot. So that means your ROI will always look good.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A micro-influencer allows the brand to create additional content that supports the brand. It is also perceived as an endorsement of the brand by many potential buyers. And a large percentage of people trust influencers and online reviews as much as they would trust a friend&#8217;s advice.” says David Abehsera, President and Co-founder of The Woo.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Tips on Using WhatsApp Another Handy Tool for Business</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/va-social-media-management-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4603" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/va-social-media-management-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="va-social-media-management-1" width="640" height="427" /></a>Social Media do help in spreading your words to the current and future students. It is like an open engagement with your present and potential students. Generation Z is spends a lot more time on social sites. These sites are like 2nd home to them. Another reason here is that it is better way to connect with the parents and the community. Let’s know why Social Media is that Important and How to do this engagement.</p>
<h3>Why Social Media is Important?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The outreach generated by social sites is incredible. These are the way to make interactions with the parents, alumni, students, stack holders and community. This the way they can keep up with you. This is a fastest way to generate engagement with the potential students. Demographics, images and other media are best to give them tour of your institute.</p>

(function(){function async_load(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='http://pewinternet.org/wp-content/plugins/pew-scripts/js/iframeResizer.min.js';s.onload=s.onreadystatechange=function(){var rs=this.readyState;try{iFrameResize([],'iframe#pew17381')}catch(e){}};var embedder=document.getElementById('pew-iframe');embedder.parentNode.insertBefore(s,embedder)}if(window.attachEvent)window.attachEvent('onload',async_load);else window.addEventListener('load',async_load,false)})();
// ]]&gt;</script></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These micro blogging sites are good for making sharing classroom announcements. This way students connected with you on social media can get updates frequently. Lectures and events shared on blogs and micro blog engage with more people sooner. It opens gate to make interactions with students and faculties from other institute. Sharing ideas and knowledge with them helps in developing a good professional image.</p>
<h3>How to Use these Micro Blogging Sites?</h3>
<h4>Engagement:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Make a strategy, plan on what type of the audience you are going to engage with these sites. Your micro-blogging car is without the steering because you are running the campaign without making any strategies. You need to make list all kind of resource and staffs you’re going to make for this. Consider all the possibilities like who is going to post, who will the content provider. Also images should be unique and self made with the institutions mark on it. So you are going to need a graphic designer too.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="pew17882" src="http://pewinternet.org/chart/social-media-use-by-age/iframe/" width="100%" height="100px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><script id="pew-iframe" type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
(function(){function async_load(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='http://pewinternet.org/wp-content/plugins/pew-scripts/js/iframeResizer.min.js';s.onload=s.onreadystatechange=function(){var rs=this.readyState;try{iFrameResize([],'iframe#pew17882')}catch(e){}};var embedder=document.getElementById('pew-iframe');embedder.parentNode.insertBefore(s,embedder)}if(window.attachEvent)window.attachEvent('onload',async_load);else window.addEventListener('load',async_load,false)})();
// ]]&gt;</script></p>
<h4>Platforms:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that one always need to concentrate on the quality over the quantity. There are a lot of social sites but not each one have the same number of the users and engagement. Some sites are good for professional and some are for students. You do not need to appear on each option available out there. Choose your sharing platform wisely. As for education institutions you can go with: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn (optional) and Blog (integrated with website).</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" id="pew17893" src="http://pewinternet.org/chart/social-media-use-by-education/iframe/" width="100%" height="100px" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><script id="pew-iframe" type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
(function(){function async_load(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.async=true;s.src='http://pewinternet.org/wp-content/plugins/pew-scripts/js/iframeResizer.min.js';s.onload=s.onreadystatechange=function(){var rs=this.readyState;try{iFrameResize([],'iframe#pew17893')}catch(e){}};var embedder=document.getElementById('pew-iframe');embedder.parentNode.insertBefore(s,embedder)}if(window.attachEvent)window.attachEvent('onload',async_load);else window.addEventListener('load',async_load,false)})();
// ]]&gt;</script></p>
<h4>Departments and Communication:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Institutions have collaboration of different department. These departments need to appear of social media with individual identity. Each department need to have individual accounts. From engineering department to commerce department and other special activity department must have different accounts. This helps student in getting their updates easily. One account for all will cause lots of mess in sharing the information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now because departments are running differently on social media, they need be in communication at campus. This communication is necessary because it allow individuals to share their ideas openly. Also it increases number of collaborations from the students from other departments. They learn new strategies and idea that help each department’s reach grow.</p>
