<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any experience into the development of the application, you know how hard it is to find a perfect developer. If you are thinking of saving some hundred or thousands of dollar by neglecting quality then you are making a big mistake. It is always hard when it comes to finding out a solution with <strong><a style="color: red;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/" target="_blank">mobile applications</a></strong>. So you need a right guide to choose a better developer. You should invest good, not much not less. But you should know better the app be greater the revenue will become.</p>
<h3><strong>Developer That Take Interest:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An Application Developer or development company should not just be making an app for you. But they should share their experience of making app into same domain. They should tell you what are users seeking into this kind of apps. What are the solutions they can provide you from their experience? A developer must take interest in your business or idea of applications.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What User Looks Into App:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The application developer must have a good experience in <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></strong></span> skills. You must check their portfolio. A user downloads an app only if they get impressed by the UI in the screenshot. Apps are all the show of attracting eyes of a user. If your app can’t make a good impression it will fail. Also if the app is failed in user experience, then the product will fail again. You need to impress the audience with the first attempt.</p>
<h3><strong>What Other says About Them:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No one has that long life that will give them the experience of everything. You should remember that they have experience into this. That means they have some clients too. Try to get reviews from those who have worked with them before. Reviews will help you in sorting out the right one for you without any hassle.</p>
<h3><strong>Go Through Full App Lifecycle:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An app developer should keep working on the application throughout its lifecycle. Choose someone who can be there with an app whole time. Company or developer should not abandon the app just after it is completed or hosted. Applications need to evolve with time to time. This evolution is based on the reviews given by the user.</p>
<h3><strong>Quality will Pay You in Long Term:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you are into <span style="color: #ff0000;"><a style="color: #ff0000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/android-app-development/" target="_blank"><strong>application development</strong></a></span> you should make sure that you are with good one. You are here to make a good product so don’t go with some cheap one. Don’t make saving money is your only goal here. Yes, no one comes with a great budget but still, you need to make a decent investment in the app. Mobile Apps are long-term running projects and cheap investment will break it before your estimated life cycle.</p>
<h3><strong>Be with a Team:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Every project is done by a team where everyone has their own role to play. Everyone is expert in their own field. So never go with a sole developer. He may make a better performing application but not a good UI and UX. Why? Because it is not his cup of tea. Have a team while doing development or have a good company that will provide you with every asset regarding the application development.</p>

This will be just waste of the fuel. You are basically wasting your resources. This very thing happens when you are into mobile UI and UX. When you don’t know what problem lies in it then how are you going to solve them? All you need here is to detect the problem, define them. We are into <a href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/mobile-application/" target="_blank">mobile application development</a> for more than 6 years. We have designed many mobile UI and UX at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What we have learned here from our experience is that you need a follow-up plan before narrowing down your problems. You need to prepare a plan that does not limit your innovation and imagination. You need to be more creative with your solution than the product itself. We must not stop our possibilities. This streamline will help you with all the problems you are about to solve. Let&#8217;s talk about them in brief.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Perspective of User:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know what UI means, User Interface, so why we lack user perspective in making one. We need to think of it form the user’s end. For that, we have to put on user’s shoes and then see the UI. Here the user is what all that matter.</p>
<h4>Setting Up the Definition:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you started thinking as a user then you must take out the problems, point to point. It will be a report documented with all the problem that a user will face. Let&#8217;s say if your app’s interface is too much simple that user of 17-22 age group will not find it attractive. And if they didn’t take interest in the app how is it going to last in market.</p>
<h4>Do it with your Team:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teamwork is what always pay you better. Make a team let them use your application. Now this will create a vantage point for the same UI. You will find many little and big problems in that. This will save your time and efforts. This is like pointing out on the map now all you need is to connect all these dots and find your way.</p>
<h4>Problem Statements are the Solution:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These statements are the solution here. All the thing you are going to take need to be action oriented. These problems must be focused on the methods you are using to make goods. Go with your team and get their solution point to point but they need to be narrow. If you are focusing on the broad area then there is no point in that. Like if the point is “UI is not attractive.” Then there will be only waste of time and resource because you are going to change the whole UI. But one needs to point out what part makes it unattractive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Same happens when it comes to the making them too narrow. Like “Change Font Style, It is not visible.” What will that do is making you paranoid over font style. It will stop you from thinking that you can replace them with icons those are more understandable. This way you can save your resources easily. Not just it, you can also try questioning your UI and UX. Ask then “Why” and you will make good profit.</p>
