An innovative contemporary layout and responsive website design are sure to excite your clients. Its all depend on your website looks and quality of content. It depends on your services, products or information which you are displaying there. Some people suggest a beautiful colored website has much impact. If we focused on it, web pages color doesn’t much impact, it will impress the eyes for few seconds. If you keep a quality of content with proper detailed information of your products and services in your website that will attract the more clients.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Static website design is a better option if you don’t want to spend much for your <b>Online Presence</b>. It will give you a less demanding and approachable option with a little effort but have a proper information which helps to target your goal. For a static website, you will not able to change it frequently but you can put all things in a detailed manner on your website pages. Which helps to make it more impressive.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This was a way to attract clients through the designing of the website. Now, we will take a discussion of some strategy which helps to gain valuable users. </span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>“<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">How to get qualified leads?”</span></span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>“ <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Where do I find web design clients?”</span></span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Every freelancer or a company has asked themselves these questions. You can get a great work and able to justify your decision to your own boss if your financial stability is good. Financial stability, to achieve this you have to have clients. There is some strategy which is used to find the clients for your business.</span></span></p>
<h1 align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Proposals</b></span></h1>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The proposal is a critical component to find clients for your business. There are two types of people one is writing a quality proposal and another who doesn’t. A good proposal is used to pitch new business to cold leads. To make a good proposal it includes three major points Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, and Pricing Information. </span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Problem Statement</b></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The problem statement is the thing, what they need you understand that exactly. Problem Statement is used to improvements in project specifications as compared to describe the problems. We can understand it with an example given below which differ between a simple and effective problem statement.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A simple problem statement &#8211;</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A company wants to redesign their website to give a new look. It may include an option for customers to find the location and contact the company.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">An effective problem statement &#8211;</span></span></p>
<p align="justify">A company has recently seen a radical increase in competition. These competitors have a contemporary website which is starting to attract their company&#8217;s longtime customers. So your company needs to redesign your website with an attractive modern look to keep your existing customers and add new ones. This redesigning of the website includes a way to find the location and contact the company for customers.</p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b>Proposed Solution</b></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Proposed Solution is used to offer a solution to problems when you equipped with the knowledge of what motivates the client. It&#8217;s related to describe the benefits of understanding the current situation to the desired result. We Can understand it by taking an example of simple and effective proposed solution.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A <strong>simple</strong> proposed solution &#8211;</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A company needs to complete redesign of their existing website. This would include a location search, contact form page, and an updated logo.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">An <strong>effective</strong> problem statement &#8211;</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">To reconstruct your reputation level in the market from new competitors, the website design must implement a focused strategy on this goal. For this, identify and analysis of the key elements of the website, different customer types with necessary calls to action.</span></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It will be followed by a plan to focus on specific goals and will move into the design phase which includes a new logo, contact form page and location search.</span></span></p>
<h2 align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><b><span lang="en-US">Pricing Information</span></b></span></h2>
<p align="justify"><strong>“<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">How much is this going to cost?”</span></span></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This is a common question in every client’s mind. For any effective proposal, pricing information is a major element. It is a process where a business sets the price to sell its products and services. It will go more complicated when you are discussing it with the client. Because he wants to negotiate the price as much as possible. So, here you need to specify some specific milestones to tie payments depends on the length of projects.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We all have heard of web services once if you are in IT or <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/"><strong>website development</strong></a></span>. If you look up to the Internet then you will find that it has several definitions and several uses. In simple words, we can say that it is an open standard based web applications that interact with other applications. Also, it can turn your current application into a web application. So here we will be discussing WHAT, WHY and HOW of web service.</p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>What is a Web Service?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web services are like an application that communicates with other application or web application with a standard XML messaging system. XML encodes communication of a web service with other. As all the communication is happening XML that makes it platform independent. Now JAVA can communicate with Perl or Unix with Windows. Web services are not dependent on what language another application is or on which OS it is running. Use of XML encoded communication made this happen here.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In other words from the Internet, we can say it is completely modular, distributed and dynamic application. When it is invoked, called or executed it creates products, supply chain and process. These web services are built on the top open standards as HTTP, IP, HTML, XML. A Web service uses the Internet as a medium of the conversation with another application. Web services create a communication line that serves as internal comm line of one system. A web service requires 3 basic elements for itself:</p>
<p><strong>A. SOAP (Simple Access Object Protocol)</strong></p>
<p><strong>B. UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration)</strong></p>
<p><strong>C. WSDL (Web Service Description Language)</strong></p>
<p><span id="more-4804"></span></p>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>How does a Web Service Work?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we have discussed that Web services use open standards like HTML, XML, SOAP to build a communication bridge between applications. For this it takes help of:</p>
<p><strong>XML</strong>: It tags or encodes the data that need to be transferred between applications.</p>
<p><strong>SOAP</strong>: It is a way to send the message from the client or provokers side.</p>
<p><strong>WSDL</strong>: It let web service know that if the server is available or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So you can build a service based on the JAVA on editors. This service is easily accessible by the visual basic that run on windows. Also, you can make web services on C# on the Windows and call it on Linux based system. There will be no change in its objective or working module.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Why One Need Web Services?</strong></span></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a web service is prepared, it becomes a unit of managed code. This code can be revoked by sending a request via the network. Once your service is exposed on the Internet other applications can start communicating with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web services are used to makes applications independent of the language and applications. As we talked about it, it is a communication medium. Now a Java-based application talks to a Visual Basic-based application.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Web services use standardized standard web industry protocol. All the layer of the service uses well-defined protocols pf the services. This increases quality, choices and reduces the cost of the service.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of using B2B/ EDI proprietary solutions for communication, it uses SOAP over HTTP. More cost effective and works well on the low-cost internet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Designing is kept on evolving with the time. From drawing on rocks in the stone age to making digital designs on the web, designing evolved. But it is trends that actually make it more changing. People’s creativity is collaborating through time. These creative ideas are another reason for evolution. A website is a medium of conversation of you with your user/ visitor. Here <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">website design</a></span></strong></span> plays a major role in keeping them connected with you. So our team of web designing made a list of trend those are running in 2024.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">Web Design</a></span> with Animations:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many big names like Facebook and Twitter are using interactive and attractive animation to catch eyes. GIFs, CSS or JS animations are best to make your website say something. A website is not just a web page that you design with some text on it. It is what makes impressions so make sure it looks great. The information that website holds need to be interactive. It should put a good impression on the user. This is the way to make impacts of your brand. Make your content and information move not just lying dead on pages.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chaos in Grids:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we try to make something more good looking we try to put things in order. But we have seen beauty in chaos. There is design those are inspired by grids placed out of the arrangement. Grid present with information on anywhere on website is what stands them out. Not just these grids are out of order their content is also. Grid was once used to bring logic and harmony into the web design layout. But now it is something different. They are used same as before. Grids now bring adrift in the design that let image and text make better conversation. The position of content images breaking the boundaries brings unexpected overlapping beautiful design.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #12a0ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong><em>“Good Design is as little design as possible.”</em>&#8211; Dieter Rams</strong></span></h2>
<h3><strong>Typography is Bliss:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one’s business is like fashion, product sale or kind that require showcase then this is best you got. Typography or big size texts content are new trends that are used to attract people. Its use on the website is increasing this year. It is like this is an era of maximalism, an era evolved from minimalism when things were used to be clean. You will find a better example of Typography on <span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong><a style="color: #00ccff;" href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/" target="_blank">Brutalist</a></strong></span>. This website has a good collection of different and brutal website design.</p>
<h3><strong>Game of Colors and Illustration:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to UI and UX you have to take care of everything that is on your plate. In 2024 another trend that is making its appearance is the use of adventurous colors and illustrations. UI and UX design company know what it is like to not investing time on them. Design team have 1 big issue while making a website design that is images and color. They know what type of layout will be but what will be color combo. Selection of image and colors plays important in UI. Illustration of images also comes handy when combined with good colors.</p>
<h3><strong>Curves Came in 2017:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years, Web and Mobile <span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong><a style="color: #00ccff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></strong></span> used to have sharp edge and corners. This trends ran for very long enough but in 2017 curves came in. Now from Google to Twitter to Facebook, everyone has introduced curves in their applications, AI and other things. Not designs are curvier from corners than before. That Card style is outdated now. Not just that now design is made more cartoonish with vibrant colors and patterns of shapes. Changing a little angle of perspective may make a website more fresh and catchy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So basically designs are a matter of creativity. One has to keep applying innovative designs and creative ideas to their designs. Web design services are hard to find with great output but you can trust our name here. We are the one who keeps updated with the trends of technology to deliver our best to our best.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Web development is a major unit when you are into business. It plays a vital role if you are into expanding more or stable. The website remains with you all the time. So what a website perform for you:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a service showcase template that highlights what your company can do.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A website lists you online with public access on the most search engine.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a self-promotional practice.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Through the blog, you can share your opinion with the world.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is a service offering proposal with text and other media.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Services like SEO let you help see who and how your customer are performing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are just some little highlights what website can do. A business needs to have wed developer or support of <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development company</a></strong></span>. This support or collaboration may run for a long time but it is important. So when you select a company or web developer make sure you know them well. It not a one-time thing that you do and is done for all. It is a way of conversation with your customer and future clients.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Development never Ends:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a business asks “How long will it take to complete the website?”. Websites are rarely static now. Most of the data is dynamic and it is hard to complete while small things will keep on updating. So if small business keeps on asking when will it get done then answer is it will go on. It is not a one time process that gets done after a time. Language or technology it is developed on keeps on changing with time so do website need to be. To keep up with the trends and opportunity website development need to run time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now you need to invest wisely in this. You make sure that you don’t go with cheaper one to save money. As this is a long process it may be going cost in future. Also, don’t go with one with much price in first place. Make sure that you have a technical help like a friend or relative from the same background. Their review and knowledge will help you in choosing the right one for your business. Or you make contact with several developers or <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">website development company</a></strong></span>. Now you have a full information about them you can make a full analysis on your own. This will narrow down option for you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></span> are important in Website Development:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s suppose your website has all the functionality and working done perfectly. But, what is the point if it cannot attract users or make them stay. Here design and experience play a vital role. Designs are what attract your potential client. A good <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">Website design company</a></strong></span> will be a big help here. Still, you have to take care of some points those may harm your conversion with your client.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Large size media and content, like video and code, make your website heavy to load in the browser. That also slow downloading speed of a website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not put so much animation or heavy graphics that takes time to load. What is a good point in making a website that user doesn’t pay attention to? If your user doesn’t have good patience then he will move to another service provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All your content needs to be responsive and optimized. You can take help from <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/digital-marketing/seo/" target="_blank">SEO team</a></strong></span> to make sure that your website is well optimized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attractive is not enough, make it interactive and initiative. Your website must force your user to keep on browsing it and see all your service. A website must make impression on the user. They need to remember you for your services. It is the way make them return.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management is Necessary:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do development without any plan then it has more chance that you will fail at some points or you will make mistake. Make it possible that before starting a project you have a better plan for everything. If things go with a plan it goes in a very optimized way. It controls everything like cost, resources, content and other related things. Make sure that you are active at the current time. Being in a managed way will help you in managing the content of the website. By these update, a user will know how updated and managed you are. They know that you are available for users. Management help development team to do their work in very confident and in a comfortable manner.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, actually one cannot decide which language is best for web development. What is best for one developer can be a crap for another web developer. It is just matter of skills set developer to have. If one developer has good skills with one language it is best for him. Development is basically based on the control over the language. To make development more beautiful one can use 2 or more different programming languages.</p>
<p>So let’s start our topic here with:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/php/" target="_blank">PHP</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP made its debut in mid-1990. It was a revolutionary application that made it possible for a website to have a dynamic data. Before this website used to be a bulk of static data but this changed it all. It made those boring website more interactive. PHP has one problem and that is a length of the code for small tasks. It requires a lot of code to make small tasks work on a website. After 2 decades there are many languages those can replace PHP. But still the PHP is ruling its place and most programmer still prefers this language.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">Java</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was never made for <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development</a></strong></span> or web applications but still, Java is said to be one of best programing language. Java had a different sole purpose, but still, get used in website development. Java is having a very long timeline so if you are into a project that will be altered by your people or other then use Java. Why? Because a basic developer knows Java well. Java’s sole purpose was never browser related development. So if you write code in Java your team will not need new to learns to make a change or maintaining code.</p>
<h3><strong>Go a.k.a. Golang:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This language is like an extension to any development language. It is flexible and easier than Java for web applications. Go is a general purpose language but not that popular. But it has an advantage when used for applications that work on parallel processing. This advantage increases its chances of being liked in future. So it will be a good option for you to do development of web application or other application.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/python/" target="_blank">Python</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Python was also not made for web development. But then Django (a python framework) made it all easy for developers. Due to this framework, a website developer can implement functionalities from python to a website. You can also use plain old Python to do application or web development.</p>

But now it is used for the development of many different applications and solutions like system administration, database control, administration panel. Back then most of the people were used to be designers. It is right now one of the major development languages. But now people are moving toward making every new website as a SaaS. Here we will make discussion on how to make better web and application development with PHP.</p>
<h4>Use Core PHP Function and Classes:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a better and fast development of the website or application, one can take advantage of predefined functions. These functions are defined to make sure perform some task. All you need to do you is that just call them when you need them. You don’t need to waste your time on the development of your own function. Check the manual before making any new function.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">File for configuration:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can generate a whole single file for the configuration. This will work as a master file. If you need any configuration need to be done then you only need to do that into one file. So that you will need to do that same thing into several different files. This will help in maintaining the code and will make it more modular.</p>
<h4>Error Reporting:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is one good thing if you accept your mistakes. Remember you should always keep the error reporting when you are doing the development. This ‘White Screen of Death’ is one thing that will help you improve and maximize your potential. error_reporting&#8217; and &#8216;display_errors&#8217; these will be your two friends in development.</p>
<h4>Comments:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We used to do comments in our code to make it more understanding for other and of self. But do not overdo this practice. A good code is self-explanatory. You need to be more better at making well managed code. Comment only complicated part of your code. Your code need to have a simplicity for understanding.</p>
<h4>Editor need to be Handy:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">An editor needs to be good. Your editor need to be a feature rich. These feature should help you with your development and making it more easy. Making yourself comfortable with a handy editor will make the development process more flexible.</p>
