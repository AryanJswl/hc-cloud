<p>In today&#8217;s blog we are going to talk about Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It. Jordan Walke, a former employee at Facebook, developed ReactJS. It’s an open source JavaScript library that is utilized to create user interfaces for single page apps.</p>



<p>Since it requires only a minimal understanding of HTML and JavaScript, React has risen in popularity as a front-end web development tool.</p>



<p>Without reloading web pages, developers can make certain changes in web app data. The features or purpose of this is to be easy, efficient, and quick in making a user interface for apps.</p>



<p>Here is : Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Thing which is exceptional about React JS</strong></h2>



<p>It can be easily guessed that React is not similar to other popular frameworks, like Angular or Ember. So unlike others, it is, in fact, small, developed on the concept of components and functions properly with other frameworks as well as libraries such as JQuery, etc.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rich User Interface</strong></h2>



<p>In this era, customers expert more then static HTML website from you. It is important to provide quality without load time, performance and other factor. React Js gives you everything you need to build web applications with rich user-interfaces that can promise exceptional user experiences. User-interfaces being very crucial for the success of your business, you can easily build cool UI using declarative components.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reusable Components</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="875" height="492" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g.png" alt="Benefits of React JS 7 reasons to choose It " class="wp-image-5693" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g.png 875w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-300x169.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-768x432.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-696x391.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1_yjH3SiDaVWtpBX0g_2q68g-747x420.png 747w" sizes="(max-width: 875px) 100vw, 875px" /></figure>



<p>React provides a component based structure. You start with tiny components like button, checkbox, dropdown etc. and the you create wrapper components composed of those smaller components. And then you write higher level wrapper components. And, it goes on like that until you have this one root component and that component is your app.</p>



<p>Each component decides how it should be rendered. Each component has its own internal logic. This approach has some amazing results. You can re-use components anywhere you need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Testing and Functionality</strong></h2>



<p>Developers can use the ReactJS framework for browsing ecmascript6 modules that define reliance and can utilize it with Babel, reacts-di, etc. These are simple to test and can be treated as the present state’s function.</p>



<p>They can be monitored from the triggered functions, output, events, etc. You need to test prior to using and React JS definitely makes it very easy for doing it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ease of Migration</strong></h2>



<p>Unlike Google’s Angular framework, which had faced a very alarming compatibility issue between version 1.x and 2.0, the ReactJS library supports a wide range of codebases and can be mixed into any existing infrastructure without shutting down the system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="b01b">Clean Abstraction</h2>



<p>One of the powerful sides of React is that it provides a good abstraction which means that it does not expose any complex internals to the user.</p>



<p>Compare this to Angular: Why on earth should you have to learn an internal process such as digest cycles? Those kind of details better be kept as internals to provide a clean abstraction. You only need to understand a component’s life cycles, states and props to master React to accomplish everything you need.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Strong community support</strong></h2>



<p>Like Angular, React also has very strong community support, which is one of the main reasons to adopt React JS in your project.</p>



<p>Every day, a large number of individual React developers are contributing towards making React a better frontend framework. Currently, React JS has attained 136.079 starts on Github and 1,331 regular contributors.</p>

<p>7 JavaScript Tricks learn in less than 5 min. JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages at the moment. avaScript is the number one programming language in the world, the language of the web, of mobile hybrid apps (like PhoneGap or Appcelerator), of the server side (like NodeJS or Wakanda) and has many other implementations. You can also learn more about <strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color"><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/websites-for-learning-javascript/">JavaScript</a></span></strong> and complete <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Complete-JavaScript-Programming-Start-to-End">guide to JavaScript</a></strong>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s important to learn the tricks and shortcut in javascript and you need to invest less than 5 min.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create an array with unique values using the “Set” object</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Imagine a array with a duplicate item and you want to show only unique items. You could try writing a <em>map</em> or <em>filter </em>to achieve this. Alternatively, ES6 introduces the <strong><em>Set object</em></strong>, which solves this problem in just 1 line of code.

const uniqueItemsarray = [...new Set([1, 2, 3, 3,])]</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Create Empty Objects</h2>



<p>Sure you can create an object that seems empty with <code>{}</code>, but that object still has a <code>__proto__</code> and the usual <code>hasOwnProperty</code> and other object methods. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">let dict = Object.create(null);</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Merge Several Objects Together</h2>



<p>There is always a need to merge in javascript the need to merge two or more classes, and this was my go-to approach. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">const student = { 
 name: 'John Wick', 
 gender: 'Male' 
 };const school = { 
 primary: 'St Xavier School', 
 secondary: 'Paul Secondary School' 
 };const skills = { 
 programming: 'Extreme', 
 swimming: 'Average', 
 sleeping: 'Pro' 
 };const summary = {...user, ...college, ...skills};</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Using the window.location object</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="750" height="422" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript.jpg" alt="7 JavaScript Tricks learn in less than 5 min " class="wp-image-5557" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript.jpg 750w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JavaScript-746x420.jpg 746w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" /></figure>



<p>JavaScript can access the current URL using the <strong>window.location </strong>object. Pretty neat, but even cooler is that this object contains certain parts of the URL as well. 7 JavaScript Tricks learn in less than 5 min.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">// JavaScript can access the current URL in parts. For this URL:
`https://thatsanegg.com/example/index.html?s=article`window.location.protocol == `https:`
window.location.host == `thatsanegg.com`
window.location.pathname == `/example/index.html`
window.location.search == `?s=article`</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Avoid negative indexes in arrays</strong></h2>



<p>This is a simple trick of avoiding negative indexes </p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>var numbersArray = &#91;1,2,3,4,5]; 
var from = numbersArray.indexOf("foo") ;  // from is equal to -1 
numbersArray.splice(from,2);    // will return &#91;5]</code></pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Destructuring with Aliases</h2>



<p>The <strong>destructuring assignment</strong> syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">const object = { number: 10 };
const { number } = object;// Grabbing number and renaming it as otherNumber
const { number: otherNumber } = object;console.log(otherNumber);</pre>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Pass functions, not strings, to <code>setTimeout()</code> and <code>setInterval()</code></strong></h2>



<p>If you pass a string into <code>setTimeout()</code> or <code>setInterval()</code>, the string will be evaluated the same way as with <code>eval</code>, which is slow. Instead of using…</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>setInterval('doSomethingChronologically()', 1000);  
setTimeout('doSomethingAfterFiveSeconds()', 
5000);
setInterval(doSomethingPeriodically, 1000);  
setTimeout(doSomethingAfterFiveSeconds, 5000);</code></pre>

This might be a bad idea before but now Zeplin is here to help. It allows a developer to be a good designer by following the simple guideline. Before that every work that a designer has done end up in a flattened work. This happens because developers don’t share the same perspective as of designer and things start losing in the transaction. Now, this is saved by the Zeplin by translating Photoshop and Sketch file into a free Mac, Windows or Web-App. “The best part is that Zeplin provides a quick reference for the colors, dimensions, and fonts from your designs,” says James Stiff. It also creates color suggestions for you.</p>

It has an option to design things in a nested form. With this you can design in a structured manner, Pattern Lab comes with a device-agnostic viewport to help you make your website responsive.</p>

These tools are just extended hand of yours that will save you time. A better web design will bring your audience into a good streamline. We are sewing up all these from different tools from different lists. This is to get you the test of best on best web design tools. These are some tools those are free and some are paid.

<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Sketch- Exclusive Web Design Tool for Mac OS X:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5015 size-full" title="Sketch- Exclusive Web Design Tool for Mac OS X" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sketch-Web-Design-Tool-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>When it comes to web design or UI design then Photoshop is a good tool to help you with. But when you want to save you time and giving you extra feature, Sketch should be your first choice. This application is exclusively for Mac. No windows version is available here. In recent time Adobe has introduced Adobe XD that was officially launched in October. Still, people prefer Sketch over Adobe products. The thing is that as the project file size increases, Photoshop starts to lose control.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Photoshop can’t handle a large file with smoothness. But due to the design of Sketch being in full vector mode, its project file is comparatively small. Also, it does not lose control as the file size increases. Also, the sketch is much easier than the Photoshop with its minimalist interface. You will find a plug-in for everything in Sketch App. You still need Photoshop if you want edit photo but in UI and Web design Sketch is stepping ahead.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Adobe XD- Alternative for Sketch on Window:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5011 size-full" title="Adobe XD- Alternative for Sketch on Window" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Adobe-XD-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>It is a vector design and wireframing tool by the Adobe. It made its official appearance in October. Before that is was on its Beta version in May. It has a drawing tool, non-static integration defining tool, mobile and desktop preview app and many more. The thing that makes it more useful is its preloaded content. One thing that you will love about it is that you can copy things from other Adobe app. Although Adobe XD do not replace Sketch but there is one problem that Sketch have. It is hard to believe that every web designer is working on OS X or simply Mac. Adobe XD is available on both and that makes file sharing flexible with it. You can cope with your team easily.</p>
<h1><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Figma- Available to All Web Designer Tool:</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5014 size-full" title="Figma- Available to All Web Designer Tool" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Figma-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Figma is another tool that is used to build a beautiful interface. This application allows multiple designers to collaborate in real time. The best thing about it is that it is available on all platform, web, Windows, Mac and Linux. You can take help from people within the application. Also, the designing on the Figma is comparatively quick. Many web developers are using this application for collaboration.

Also, it is good for making landing page or other design frameworks. It can generate great designs easily for desktop, tablet and mobile.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff;">Affinity Designer- The Photoshop Killer:</span></strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5012 size-full" title="Affinity Designer- The Photoshop Killer" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design.jpg" alt="web design, Top tools, Website design, New Website Design tools, Best Website design Tools" width="800" height="300" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design-300x113.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Affinity-Design-696x261.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Serif’s Affinity Killer has got his nickname ‘Photoshop Killer’. It has a good collection of dedicated web and graphic design tools. One thing that is like a bliss in Affinity is 1,000,000 zoom function. That helps you get so deep into your art. Especially when you are working on vectors. Photoshop has 32,000 zooms only that some time is not enough. Also, affinity allows going back 8000 steps. What Affinity did here is that they made a similar UI to Photoshop. So if you are new in this you can start designing so easily. Also, its affordable price makes it worth giving a shot.</p>
