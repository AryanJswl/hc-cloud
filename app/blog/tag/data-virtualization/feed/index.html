<p>Hello everyone! In this blog, you are going to learn about how to Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components. Commonly people says <strong>Practice Make a Man Perfect </strong>but you should practice in a way that it makes you perfect in that thing. So before jumping into mastering Hadoop Let&#8217;s talk about some Basics of Hadoop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What do you mean by Hadoop?</strong></h2>



<p>Hadoop is a open source platform for storing large volume of data and running applications on clusters of commodity software. It gives us massive amount of space and data storage facility, ability to handle different virtually limitless tasks.&nbsp;Its main job is to support big data components and support  some advanced analytics like Predictive analytics, data mining, ML</p>



<p>Now you get idea about Hadoop lets discuss about it&#8217;s components. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hadoop Ecosystem</strong></h2>



<p>All the components of the Hadoop ecosystem, as explicit entities are evident. Hadoop architecture gives prominence to Hadoop common, <strong>Hadoop YARN, Hadoop Distributed File Systems (HDFS) and Hadoop Map</strong> Reduce of the Hadoop Ecosystem. Hadoop common provides all Java libraries, utilities, OS level abstraction, necessary Java files and script to run Hadoop, while Hadoop YARN is a framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now Tip to master this ecosystem </h2>



<p>Learn Linux commands For installing Hadoop, Linux is preferred to be the operating system and <strong>UBUNTU </strong>as server distribution. So it&#8217;s a advise you should have a basic knowledge of Linux before start learning Hadoop. It is a good practice if you are aware of few commands in Linux.</p>



<p><strong>FOCUS ON UNDERSTANDING</strong> all the different components like <strong>HDFS, MapReduce, and Yarn</strong> in the architecture. Once you get the picture of this architecture, then focus on the overall Hadoop ecosystem&nbsp;which means you  need to have knowledge about all the tools.</p>



<p>To understand each and every thing step by step I will suggest <strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Data-Science"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshisha Platform</span></a></strong> to learn the basic components and ecosystem of Hadoop and DataScience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>HDFS (Hadoop Distribution File System)</strong></h2>



<p><strong>HDFS</strong>&nbsp;is the primary storage system of Hadoop.&nbsp; It is a java based file system that provides scalability, fault tolerance, reliable and cost efficient data storage system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two major components of Hadoop HDFS- <strong>NameNode</strong> and <strong>DataNode</strong>.  Well name node is also known as master node and it won&#8217;t store the data it will store the meta data. DataNode also known as slave node it is use to store the actual data.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>MapReduce</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>&nbsp;is the core Hadoop ecosystem component which provides data processing. It is a software for easy writing applications. MapReduce programs are parallel in nature, thus are very useful for performing large-scale data analysis using multiple machines in the cluster.</p>



<p>I hope you like this blog <strong>Master Hadoop Ecosystem and Their Components </strong>to learn more visit <strong><a href="http://hawkscode.com"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">HawksCode</span></a></strong> and <a href="http://news.easyshiksha.com"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Easyshiksha</span></strong></a></p>

<p>Our todayâ€™s topic is&nbsp;<strong>What is Tableau?</strong>. I hope you guys have heard a lot about this tool from many people. Many people who work as Business Intelligence, Business Analyst, Data Analyst use this tool. So now the question arises in your mind Is this related to Data? or Use to organize data? Well, the answer is It helps in simplifying raw data into a very easily understandable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Tableau </strong>is a powerful and rapidly growing data visualization tool used in the BI, BA and Data Analytics Industry. It make Data analysis very fast and the visualizations created are in the form of dashboards and worksheets. It even allows a non-tech person to create dashboards. Learn courses online on&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="color:#2919de" class="has-inline-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span style="color:#361ce2" class="has-inline-color">.</span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Firstly you need to understand about&nbsp;<strong>virtualization</strong></h2>



<p><strong>data virtualization&nbsp;</strong>is a pictorial representation of a given set of data. A text-based data is represented in a form of charts, tables, infographics, etc. So that new insight and hidden pattern of data can be detected and understands in a more easy way. Tableau plays a key role in Business Intelligence. I hope now you understand&nbsp;<strong>What is Tableau?</strong> and why Tableau a Powerful Tool</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are three features in tableau which help in analysing data efficiently.</h2>



<ol><li>Data Blending</li><li>Real-time analysis</li><li>collaboration of data</li></ol>



<p>Tableau was founded by Pat Hanrahan, Christian Chabot, and Chris Stolte in 2003. Tableau has a <strong>mapping functionalities </strong>which helps to plot coordinates and connect to spatial files. Tableau become popular because of its easy drag-and-drop functionality, it is faster than other BI tools, high scalability as it adapts to the individual as well as enterprise needs easily, it has mobile compatibility, connectivity to a huge number of data sources without needing to buy connector license,<strong><a href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/big-data-a-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span style="color:#3425db" class="has-inline-color">big data</span></a></strong>&nbsp;analytics capabilities etc.</p>
