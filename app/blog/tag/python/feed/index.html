<p>Introduction to D3.js for data visualization. D3.js is a JavaScript library used to manipulate documents based on data. It uses HTML, CSS, and SVG to create visual representations of data which can be viewed on any modern browser. it is a&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;tool.</p>



<p>Create a folder named&nbsp;<strong>d3js_projects</strong>. Create an HTML file in the folder named&nbsp;<strong>project_1.html</strong>.&nbsp; You can also learn about&nbsp;<strong>visualization</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/">Easyshiksha Certification</a></strong></p>



<p>create a simple html web page</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;title&gt;My first page&lt;/title&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;/head&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;body&gt; Web Page&lt;/body&gt;</p>



<p>&lt;html&gt;</p>



<p>after this just setup D3.js with this code in head element. Rember one thing script code will be written in head elament.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&lt;script&nbsp;type=&#8221;text/javascript&#8221;&nbsp;src=&#8221;d3.v2.min.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="310" height="163" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png" alt="" class="wp-image-5563" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download.png 310w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-300x158.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 310px) 100vw, 310px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>After this setup the source</strong></h2>



<p>To test our D3.js setup we open the inspect element tool kit.</p>



<p>In the element tab of webkit Inspector, we open all of the elements so that we can see the whole HTML structure.&nbsp;we then hover over the d3.vs.min.js src.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>DOM Section</strong></h2>



<p>&nbsp;Using D3.js, we can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), meaning we can select elements and apply various transformations on the data visualization.</p>



<p><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;<br>&lt;title&gt;Learn D3 in 5 minutes&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Today is a beautiful day!!&lt;/h3&gt;<br>&lt;script src='https://d3js.org/d3.v4.min.js'&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;<br>d3.select('h3').style('color', 'darkblue');<br>d3.select('h3').style('font-size', '24px');&lt;/script&gt;<br><br></code></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">select method is used to make manupulations and or add data in a element.</h2>



<p>So we’re simply chaining the&nbsp;<code>select()</code>&nbsp;method on the&nbsp;<code>d3</code>&nbsp;object, and then following up with&nbsp;<code>style()</code>. The first parameter dictates what we want to change and the second gives the value. Here’s the result:</p>



<p>The next concept you’ll need to learn is data binding, as that’s one of the coolest features of D3. Using it, we can populate or manipulate DOM elements in real-time. Introduction to D3.js for data visualization</p>



<p>In our HTML, we have a simple unordered list&nbsp;<code>&lt;</code>ul&gt;:&nbsp; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;</p>



<p>We want to create the list elements using a data object. Here’s the code for doing exactly that:</p>



<p>&lt;script&gt;</p>



<p>var languages=[&#8216;java&#8217;, &#8216;python&#8217;, &#8216;javascript&#8217;, &#8216;c++&#8217;];</p>



<p>d3.select(&#8220;ul&#8221;) //firstly we will select the ul</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp; .selectAll(&#8220;li&#8221;) //now we are selecting all the data is li as a array. but li is no present in code</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; &nbsp;.data(languages) //language is the array passed in data it will run up to 4 times</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp; .enter() // enter will check if li is present or not</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">&nbsp;.append(&#8220;li&#8221;) // with append we will add li</h5>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading"> .text(function(d){return d;});&nbsp;</h5>



<p>&lt;/script&gt;</p>

<p>In this article, we are going to learn about&nbsp;<strong>the top five programming languages of the world</strong>, you should start learning now.</p>



<p>Have you ever heard of python? C? C++?Java? All will say “what are you talking about? A non-programmer ever know this!” That’s true. IncludeHelp also knows that his readers have already explored a few miles on the road of C, C++, Java, and Python. Maybe still miles to go, but you all know about the languages. Below is the <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. <strong>Python</strong></h2>



<p>This century loves to work with data, loves to train their machine and believes in artificial intelligence. Python is such a genuine &amp; general purpose language that helps you to explore all that you want to do. Python has been announced as the “most popular language of 2024” by&nbsp;TIOBE index. We believe the same too. Python is probably the best weapon of a geek who is working on data science, artificial intelligence, machine learning and software development of course.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Python first:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Not difficult to learn</li><li>Multiple programming paradigms</li><li>Robust standard library</li><li>A nice platform for developers</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. JavaScript</strong></h2>



<p>We have listed JavaScript as 2nd one due to his huge usage and demand in the ongoing tech-world. JavaScript is the basic building block for any frontend application. Now a days NodeJs is widely used for website development frameworks, which is actually JavaScript based.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JavaScript:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Must one for Full-stack developer</li><li>Needed to fame any frontend application</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. Swift</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="585" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png" alt="Top Five Programming Languages of the World" class="wp-image-5728" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-300x171.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-768x439.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-696x398.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/591ee52bcdfa-735x420.png 735w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Swift is a scripting language which has become so popular in last few years only. It was launched in 2014 and has introduced now a high-paid career path. This is mainly being used in distributed computing as it allows writing scripts that distribute program execution across distributed computing resources, including clusters, clouds, grids, and supercomputers.Swift is being constantly used in economic and biometric modelling.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn Swift:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Has a great future opportunity regarding career</li><li>A really nice scripting language4.</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Java</h2>



<p>You all are familiar a bit with Java. Probably, this was the language you learnt in your past school times or maybe junior college days. Java is powerful for its Object Oriented paradigm. Java is most famous for android development, IOT, edge device development. Strong OOP concept felicitates java as top application developing language.</p>



<p><strong>Reasons you should learn JAVA:</strong></p>



<p>Object oriented nature Java applets</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>5. C++</strong></h2>



<p>C++ is known to be a core language. It’s a highly efficient &amp; reliable language. It has been on demand due to high performance &amp; wide usage. Do you know Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X Google application (most of them), Mozilla Firefox, Adobe systems (major applications) are written in C++? <strong>top five programming languages of the world.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-development-Company-min-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-development-Company-min-2.jpg" alt="Web Development Company Australia" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-development-Company-min-2.jpg 1000w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-development-Company-min-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-development-Company-min-2-696x465.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-development-Company-min-2-629x420.jpg 629w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, actually one cannot decide which language is best for web development. What is best for one developer can be a crap for another web developer. It is just matter of skills set developer to have. If one developer has good skills with one language it is best for him. Development is basically based on the control over the language. To make development more beautiful one can use 2 or more different programming languages.</p>
<p>So let’s start our topic here with:</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/php/" target="_blank">PHP</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">PHP made its debut in mid-1990. It was a revolutionary application that made it possible for a website to have a dynamic data. Before this website used to be a bulk of static data but this changed it all. It made those boring website more interactive. PHP has one problem and that is a length of the code for small tasks. It requires a lot of code to make small tasks work on a website. After 2 decades there are many languages those can replace PHP. But still the PHP is ruling its place and most programmer still prefers this language.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/software/java/" target="_blank">Java</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was never made for <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #0000ff;"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development</a></strong></span> or web applications but still, Java is said to be one of best programing language. Java had a different sole purpose, but still, get used in website development. Java is having a very long timeline so if you are into a project that will be altered by your people or other then use Java. Why? Because a basic developer knows Java well. Java’s sole purpose was never browser related development. So if you write code in Java your team will not need new to learns to make a change or maintaining code.</p>
<h3><strong>Go a.k.a. Golang:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This language is like an extension to any development language. It is flexible and easier than Java for web applications. Go is a general purpose language but not that popular. But it has an advantage when used for applications that work on parallel processing. This advantage increases its chances of being liked in future. So it will be a good option for you to do development of web application or other application.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/python/" target="_blank">Python</a></span>:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Basically, Python was also not made for web development. But then Django (a python framework) made it all easy for developers. Due to this framework, a website developer can implement functionalities from python to a website. You can also use plain old Python to do application or web development.</p>
