										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5110" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg" alt="Google, Trends, SEO, Data, Work" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg 1280w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>Before 2006, we were unable to know what people are interested in or if something big has happened. Google Trends is world’s largest real time search data set. On this tool, one can have access to what people are searching in different regions of the world. Every year trillions of the search query are generated and Google keeps storing and analyzing the data. So if anything big happened you can interpret the news with Google Trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might look similar to the Google Keyword Planner but what it shows is a popularity over the time. There is a big difference here when it comes to long-term trending keywords and short term. If you are writing blogs that trend for a while go for keywords those are trending in present time. But if you are planning to keep your web page trending then go for long term keywords.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>What is Google Trends Data?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The data that Google trends have is an unbiased data that is searched by billions of people from around the world. This data categorized, do not identify persons and well arranged. This allows Trend user to go with searches those are trending from worldwide to city-geography. You can manually make search too of your favorite topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is two way of time zone filter. One is Real time Filter. Real time filter picks the data for query form last 7 days. On the other hand, there is Non-real time filter. This can go back to 2004 or ~36 hours back. The query can be random or whatever you like to search. Both can’t be viewed together. Both have a different set of queries that lies in a different set of time zone.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How to Work with Trends?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we said earlier, Trends and Keyword Planner both show different data and both have different meanings. Now if you combine the data of Trends and Keyword planner you will get a better understanding of your keywords. With the help of Trends, you will know what will your potential future market. It also saves your business trip expenses for the business. Trends will let you know how trending your services are in particular country or region. So before making the trip, cross check the data with trends.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How Trends works for SEO?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Google Trends doesn’t give actual search numbers, it works best when used in combination with the Keyword Planner. Google Trends will show a “normalized” or relative level of interest over time for a prospective keyword phrase. It also allows you to compare the level of interest among potential target phrases. It also breakdowns the geo tagging by the ‘search by region’. Also, it is a big help in regional or local SEO. When it comes to content writing trends let you know what people are interested in. So grab the combine it with some keywords and your post is going to flourish with great traffic and top rank.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-Design-Comapny-and-Service-Original.jpg"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4796" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-Design-Comapny-and-Service-Original.jpg" alt="design, web, website, trends" width="900" height="506" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-Design-Comapny-and-Service-Original.jpg 900w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-Design-Comapny-and-Service-Original-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-Design-Comapny-and-Service-Original-696x391.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-Design-Comapny-and-Service-Original-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Designing is kept on evolving with the time. From drawing on rocks in the stone age to making digital designs on the web, designing evolved. But it is trends that actually make it more changing. People’s creativity is collaborating through time. These creative ideas are another reason for evolution. A website is a medium of conversation of you with your user/ visitor. Here <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">website design</a></span></strong></span> plays a major role in keeping them connected with you. So our team of web designing made a list of trend those are running in 2024.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">Web Design</a></span> with Animations:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many big names like Facebook and Twitter are using interactive and attractive animation to catch eyes. GIFs, CSS or JS animations are best to make your website say something. A website is not just a web page that you design with some text on it. It is what makes impressions so make sure it looks great. The information that website holds need to be interactive. It should put a good impression on the user. This is the way to make impacts of your brand. Make your content and information move not just lying dead on pages.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Chaos in Grids:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we try to make something more good looking we try to put things in order. But we have seen beauty in chaos. There is design those are inspired by grids placed out of the arrangement. Grid present with information on anywhere on website is what stands them out. Not just these grids are out of order their content is also. Grid was once used to bring logic and harmony into the web design layout. But now it is something different. They are used same as before. Grids now bring adrift in the design that let image and text make better conversation. The position of content images breaking the boundaries brings unexpected overlapping beautiful design.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #12a0ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong><em>“Good Design is as little design as possible.”</em>&#8211; Dieter Rams</strong></span></h2>
<h3><strong>Typography is Bliss:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If one’s business is like fashion, product sale or kind that require showcase then this is best you got. Typography or big size texts content are new trends that are used to attract people. Its use on the website is increasing this year. It is like this is an era of maximalism, an era evolved from minimalism when things were used to be clean. You will find a better example of Typography on <span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong><a style="color: #00ccff;" href="http://brutalistwebsites.com/" target="_blank">Brutalist</a></strong></span>. This website has a good collection of different and brutal website design.</p>
<h3><strong>Game of Colors and Illustration:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to UI and UX you have to take care of everything that is on your plate. In 2024 another trend that is making its appearance is the use of adventurous colors and illustrations. UI and UX design company know what it is like to not investing time on them. Design team have 1 big issue while making a website design that is images and color. They know what type of layout will be but what will be color combo. Selection of image and colors plays important in UI. Illustration of images also comes handy when combined with good colors.</p>
<h3><strong>Curves Came in 2017:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For years, Web and Mobile <span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong><a style="color: #00ccff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></strong></span> used to have sharp edge and corners. This trends ran for very long enough but in 2017 curves came in. Now from Google to Twitter to Facebook, everyone has introduced curves in their applications, AI and other things. Not designs are curvier from corners than before. That Card style is outdated now. Not just that now design is made more cartoonish with vibrant colors and patterns of shapes. Changing a little angle of perspective may make a website more fresh and catchy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So basically designs are a matter of creativity. One has to keep applying innovative designs and creative ideas to their designs. Web design services are hard to find with great output but you can trust our name here. We are the one who keeps updated with the trends of technology to deliver our best to our best.</p>
