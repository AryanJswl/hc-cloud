But from the past few months, cryptocurrency’s luck has run out. It is now hard to see any profiting digital currency. These digital coins are made starting with the development of ICO. These ICO are used to verify if these coins are real or not. As of 2017, price boom was a real happiness for all the investors and coin admins. But all of a sudden all the happiness just disappeared. Price of the coins was sky high in last Dec-Jan but then it starts falling.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/using-blockchain-gender-equality-how-why-and-what/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="background-color: #3366ff;">Bitcoin</span></a></span>, a famous cryptocurrency that reached at the height of $19,000 is not at $6,000. That is still better than the other <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/crypto-currency-blockchain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptocurrencies</a></span>. So many of these are not worthy of a cent now. CoinSchedule is a website that keeps its eye on the coin movement. In this high price time, many companies have raised $11.9 Billion by ICO’s by the starting of 2024. Then there is another website Dead Coins, it keeps track of dead coins. Not only price fall was the reason for shut down. Many of them are the scam, fake, or a joke or the product wasn’t materialized. Countering with these reasons many coins are now said dead and prices are now below a cent.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>“The <span style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #333333;">Cryptocurrency</span> community hasn’t decided whether they want to be anarchist rebels or to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #333333;">replace the establishment</span>.”</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="background-color: #ffcc00; color: #333333;"><strong>-Adi Shamir</strong></span></h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency or ICO market is a very risky place to make the investment into. There are many frauds and fake coins still running in the market. A fake start-up took $2 million from the investors and flew away. This is just one example, there are many cases like those cost millions of dollars to investors. Now due to decentralization, it is hard to track the company. In a <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;" href="https://cnbc.com/2024/07/02/over-800-cryptocurrencies-are-now-dead-as-bitcoin-feels-pressure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a></span>’s “Fast Money” on Friday, Arthur Hayes, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, pour his words on Bitcoin that it will cross $50,000 by the end of this year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In an article by Independent, Bitcoin has started to recover in past two days. Price made a hike of $400 in each of 2 spikes. Not only Bitcoin but other coins like Ethereum, Ripple has also shown the same fate as of bitcoin. These coins also made some hike of 5-15 percent of the previous price. There might be some chances that Cryptocurrency Market will recover and get strong as before. Since May, it is the first time that Cryptocurrency Market is showing an increase in price.</p>

Many people who have invested in it have no clue why it is happening? It again dropped by 12% today. If we take a look at its performance it fell 50% all alone this year. This fall happened when Korean Bitcoin Exchange Coinrail warned their investors of the hack attempt. People who are not looking at Bitcoin may be smiling or grinning after a while. From its all-time high $19,000 bitcoin is now floating around $6,785 as by ‘Coindesk’.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meanwhile, Ethereum and Ripple are falling down. Today they are 10% down too. Crypto-marketers are happy this year as major <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #008000;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://cryptoloins.com/" target="_blank">Cryptocurrency</a></span></strong></span> as falling. This same time last year when Bitcoin was hanging near $3000, were not founding the ground. It is a time for hope for those who were holding coins when it was up. Coinrail has its name in the top 100 bitcoin exchanges in the world. It exchanges some 50 cryptocurrencies. This hack is another big heist in the Bitcoin history. This raises the fear of people regarding Cryptocurrency’s security and investment.</p>

<p>The Coinrail in a statement, “Their system was hit with a ‘cyber-intrusion’ on Sunday. This caused the loss of 30% of coins in the exchange.” The value is quantified but a local news channel made some calculation. According to that stolen coins are worth of $32.77M. This heist took place in just an hour. Due to this heist Bitcoin made a fall of $500 and currently wondering at $6,627.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">South Korea has been the biggest market of the cryptocurrency market. Bithumb, World’s Fifth Crpyto-exchange, was hacked in July last year. This was also a big event that questioned the safety of the investment. But still, numbers of the investors is not stopping. Still, some of the buyers have enough money to play around but a little low. In a recent event, Coindesk generated a graph that showcased danger of investing into the cryptocurrency into this stretched time of risk.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Coinrail shared some words. “70% of the total coin and token reserves have been confirmed to be safely stored and moved to a cold wallet [not connected to the internet]. Two-thirds of stolen cryptocurrencies were withdrawn or frozen in partnership with related exchanges and coin companies. For the rest, we are looking into it with an investigative agency, related exchanges and coin developers.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Cryptocurrency may have recovered some time by few ups but it is falling for a long time. This much fall happened in all over the March month. Also, it is not able to sustain its value and it doesn’t look like it will soon enough. Not just sustaining, markets believe that it will be this volatile because of low trading volume. Bitcoin, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum and other might have fallen but there were some who were doing some good. Ontology and 0x are those two cryptocurrencies who performed well in this bad time. Other cryptocurrencies have shown same rise and fall in their prices.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Bitcoin showed a rise on March 28 and reached $8,200 but this doesn’t last long. This fall after a few time to $7,750 but at market roundup, it jumped back to $7,850. It may look like that it will reach to $9,000 but that will only happen when there is a spike in buy volume. Binance CEO specified that they received a letter from Japanese Financial Service Agency (FSA). He explained about this letter in his words.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“We received a simple letter from JFSA about an hour ago. Our lawyers called JFSA immediately and will find a solution. Protecting user interests is our top priority. No need to worry. Some negative news often turns out to be positive in the long term. Chinese have a proverb for this. New (often better) opportunities always emerge during times of change,”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This letter made it look like that the market fell was due to the Binance. But if Binance has the power to make market fall then it can also raise it. Cryptocurrency is still falling and 97% of world population is still figuring out whether to buy or not. And with 3% of the population, it is hard to rise again. Because the price of cryptocurrencies depends on the buy and sell-volume of the market.</p>
