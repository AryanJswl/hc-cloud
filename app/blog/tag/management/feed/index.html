<hr />
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">IAM is a framework provided to business processes that will help with management of electric and digital identity. This framework is an equipped with required policies to manage all the digital identity. This also has all the technologies those needed to handle and support identities. IAM is like a wall between critical information and employees/ users within the organization. With this, you can control privileges and circumstance of those privileges granted to the user. The IAM system is developed so that one user has only one identity.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ccff;"><strong>What Does Identity and Access Management Do?</strong></span></h3>
<hr />
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once these identities are settled IAM have a task to maintain, modify and monitor that identity. This access process will run till the “access lifecycle” of the user. So we can say that the IAM service has a goal i.e. providing access to the right enterprise to the right use of right information. This works from user’s system onboarding to permission authorization to offboarding of that user. These are words from Yassir Abousselham. He is senior VP and Chief Security Officer for Okta. Okta is an enterprise identity and access management providing company.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With the IAM administrator can make alterations in user’s role, work, limitation, keeping track or user activity and more. It can also generate a report based on those tacking. These controls are available across all over the enterprise.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ccff;"><strong>What was the Problem here?</strong></span></h3>
<hr />
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many companies are moving toward the clouds and many are already into <span style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #a30000;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff; background-color: #a30000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/services/cloud-computing/" target="_blank">cloud computing</a></strong></span>. The problem started when these companies started facing identity problem in their cloud. These were some serious problems those were not experienced before by them. It is as hard as managing data in your own data centre. But as clouds came in IT have to do more than that and for unexperienced clouds, they don’t know of.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These changes in the system and security is a very long, busy and devastating practice that shatter the security. Business got some problems here. Due this heavy process, they get more focused on managing data resolving identity problem. Their focus just gets moved from securing these clouds first and that makes it vulnerable. This creates a blind spot and increases security risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The thing here is that cybersecurity is not a joke and need to apply to any and all system of organization. But there is a big help by some cybersecurity companies and cloud computing companies. They know and have good practices with experience over these kinds of things. Now businesses who are not into IT do not have to worry or hire specialists. They can contact one of these company to take care of these things.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ccff;"><strong>How does IAM Help in Cloud Computing?</strong></span></h3>
<hr />
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;"> IAM provides password security, provision software, security-policy enforcement. This is work of Identity Access. Then on other hand identity management works software like Microsoft SharePoint, or cloud-based Office 360. Other than these some of its solutions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">API Security</span></strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Identity as a Service (IDaaS)</span></strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Customer IAM (CIAM)</span></strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Identity Analysis (IA)</span></strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Identity Management and Governance (IMG)</span></strong></h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5><strong><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Risk-Based Authentication (RBA)</span></strong></h5>
</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<hr />
<h3><span style="background-color: #00ccff;"><strong>Still, Why One Need IAM?</strong></span></h3>
<hr />
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;"> Truly speaking, it is like an important and major member of the security family. Let’s think about it as an example. There is much organization who have lots of information and user. Most of the time it happens that some user can access some those information that they should have access to. So, here IAM work as a filter layer. It will eliminate these people who shouldn’t have access to that information. It is like a security layer to your security system. This layer will reduce the complexity of your user network also reducing the risk by limiting their access.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Web development is a major unit when you are into business. It plays a vital role if you are into expanding more or stable. The website remains with you all the time. So what a website perform for you:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a service showcase template that highlights what your company can do.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">A website lists you online with public access on the most search engine.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is like a self-promotional practice.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Through the blog, you can share your opinion with the world.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">It is a service offering proposal with text and other media.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Services like SEO let you help see who and how your customer are performing.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These are just some little highlights what website can do. A business needs to have wed developer or support of <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">web development company</a></strong></span>. This support or collaboration may run for a long time but it is important. So when you select a company or web developer make sure you know them well. It not a one-time thing that you do and is done for all. It is a way of conversation with your customer and future clients.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Web Development never Ends:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When a business asks “How long will it take to complete the website?”. Websites are rarely static now. Most of the data is dynamic and it is hard to complete while small things will keep on updating. So if small business keeps on asking when will it get done then answer is it will go on. It is not a one time process that gets done after a time. Language or technology it is developed on keeps on changing with time so do website need to be. To keep up with the trends and opportunity website development need to run time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So now you need to invest wisely in this. You make sure that you don’t go with cheaper one to save money. As this is a long process it may be going cost in future. Also, don’t go with one with much price in first place. Make sure that you have a technical help like a friend or relative from the same background. Their review and knowledge will help you in choosing the right one for your business. Or you make contact with several developers or <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/web/" target="_blank">website development company</a></strong></span>. Now you have a full information about them you can make a full analysis on your own. This will narrow down option for you.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/mobile-design/" target="_blank">UI and UX</a></span> are important in Website Development:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Let&#8217;s suppose your website has all the functionality and working done perfectly. But, what is the point if it cannot attract users or make them stay. Here design and experience play a vital role. Designs are what attract your potential client. A good <span style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff; background-color: #ffff00;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/design/web-design/" target="_blank">Website design company</a></strong></span> will be a big help here. Still, you have to take care of some points those may harm your conversion with your client.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Large size media and content, like video and code, make your website heavy to load in the browser. That also slow downloading speed of a website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not put so much animation or heavy graphics that takes time to load. What is a good point in making a website that user doesn’t pay attention to? If your user doesn’t have good patience then he will move to another service provider.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All your content needs to be responsive and optimized. You can take help from <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/technologies/digital-marketing/seo/" target="_blank">SEO team</a></strong></span> to make sure that your website is well optimized.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attractive is not enough, make it interactive and initiative. Your website must force your user to keep on browsing it and see all your service. A website must make impression on the user. They need to remember you for your services. It is the way make them return.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Management is Necessary:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you do development without any plan then it has more chance that you will fail at some points or you will make mistake. Make it possible that before starting a project you have a better plan for everything. If things go with a plan it goes in a very optimized way. It controls everything like cost, resources, content and other related things. Make sure that you are active at the current time. Being in a managed way will help you in managing the content of the website. By these update, a user will know how updated and managed you are. They know that you are available for users. Management help development team to do their work in very confident and in a comfortable manner.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a strategy for managing all your company&#8217;s relationships and interactions with your customers and potential customers. It helps you improve your profitability.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More commonly, when people talk about CRM they are usually referring to a CRM system. A tool which helps with contact management, sales management, workflow processes, productivity and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Customer Relationship Management enables you to focus on your organisation’s relationships with individual people – whether those are customers, service users, colleagues or suppliers. It is not just for sales. Some of the biggest gains in productivity can come from moving beyond CRM as a sales and marketing tool. Then embed it in your business – from HR to customer services and supply-chain management.</p>
<h3>Why CRM Matter?</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your business is going to last, you know that you need a strategy for the future. You’ll already have targets relating to sales, business objectives and profitability. But getting up-to-date, reliable information on your progress towards your goals can be tricky. How do you translate the many streams of data coming in from sales teams, customer service staff, marketers and social media monitoring into useful business information?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using a CRM system can give you a clear overview of your customers. You can see everything in one place. A simple, customisable dashboard that can tell you a customer&#8217;s previous history with you. Also the status of their orders, any outstanding customer service issues, and more.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can even choose to include information from their public social media activity- their likes and dislikes, what they are saying and sharing with you. Marketers can use CRM to better understand the pipeline of sales or prospective work coming in, making forecasting simpler and more accurate. You&#8217;ll have clear visibility of every opportunity or lead, showing you the clear path from enquiries to sales.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And though it’s traditionally been used as a sales and marketing tool, customer service teams are seeing great benefits from CRM systems. Today&#8217;s customer raises their voices on the social channel like Twitter. Then they more this conversation to private email or calls. A CRM platform enables you to manage the enquiry across channels without losing track.</p>
