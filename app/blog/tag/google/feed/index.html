<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">At precisely exactly the exact identical time, Google will lengthen the time that it implements reviewing apps for your Play Store in situations where there is a programmer </span><span data-contrast="auto">not known to this business.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Google notes at a programmer blog post that, &#8220;We shall shortly be taking additional hours (days, not months) to examine apps by programmers which don&#8217;t have a track listing.&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">The review procedure that is lengthier may allow it to tackle the growing wave of apps which make it into the Play Store. Apple clarifies that generally, 50% of apps are examined in 24 hours and more than 90 percent have been examined in two days.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Google will try to create life painful for Android programmers after the crackdown on SMS and Phone Log permissions of a year. Google claims its enforcement campaign has led to a 98 percent decrease in the </span><span data-contrast="auto">number</span><span data-contrast="auto"> of apps using consumer info that is sensitive.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">The rules simply allow apps selected option for making calls or sending text messages. The crackdown resulted in apps falling performance or confronting a ban on distributing the program via the Google Play Store.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">The crackdown was declared by google as part of Project Strobe, its own endeavor to enhance the security of consumer information after finding a bug at Google+ which subjected 500,000 consumers&#8217; information.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Developer concerns center on three important topics complaints which Google took to provide responses about appeals and reviews; and also, the feeling that there were not any humans.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">To deal with these issues, Google is promising more communication info about allure and tests, and placing people.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">&#8220;People, not bots, previously examine every sensitive choice, but we&#8217;re advancing our communication so answers are far more personalized &#8212; and we&#8217;re expanding our staff to help hasten the appeals procedure,&#8221; Google says.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span data-contrast="auto">Google is currently enabling programmers to &#8220;instantly&#8221; attraction instances where a programmer account was blocked. Each appeal will likely probably be &#8220;carefully assessed by somebody on the staff&#8221;, according to Google.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:6,&quot;335551620&quot;:6,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}"> </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5110" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg" alt="Google, Trends, SEO, Data, Work" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends.jpg 1280w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-1068x601.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Trends-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></a>Before 2006, we were unable to know what people are interested in or if something big has happened. Google Trends is world’s largest real time search data set. On this tool, one can have access to what people are searching in different regions of the world. Every year trillions of the search query are generated and Google keeps storing and analyzing the data. So if anything big happened you can interpret the news with Google Trends.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It might look similar to the Google Keyword Planner but what it shows is a popularity over the time. There is a big difference here when it comes to long-term trending keywords and short term. If you are writing blogs that trend for a while go for keywords those are trending in present time. But if you are planning to keep your web page trending then go for long term keywords.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>What is Google Trends Data?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The data that Google trends have is an unbiased data that is searched by billions of people from around the world. This data categorized, do not identify persons and well arranged. This allows Trend user to go with searches those are trending from worldwide to city-geography. You can manually make search too of your favorite topic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is two way of time zone filter. One is Real time Filter. Real time filter picks the data for query form last 7 days. On the other hand, there is Non-real time filter. This can go back to 2004 or ~36 hours back. The query can be random or whatever you like to search. Both can’t be viewed together. Both have a different set of queries that lies in a different set of time zone.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How to Work with Trends?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we said earlier, Trends and Keyword Planner both show different data and both have different meanings. Now if you combine the data of Trends and Keyword planner you will get a better understanding of your keywords. With the help of Trends, you will know what will your potential future market. It also saves your business trip expenses for the business. Trends will let you know how trending your services are in particular country or region. So before making the trip, cross check the data with trends.</p>
<h2><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>How Trends works for SEO?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since Google Trends doesn’t give actual search numbers, it works best when used in combination with the Keyword Planner. Google Trends will show a “normalized” or relative level of interest over time for a prospective keyword phrase. It also allows you to compare the level of interest among potential target phrases. It also breakdowns the geo tagging by the ‘search by region’. Also, it is a big help in regional or local SEO. When it comes to content writing trends let you know what people are interested in. So grab the combine it with some keywords and your post is going to flourish with great traffic and top rank.</p>

We know how big this name is and it has its foot in many regions like job guide, music, AI, US Department of Defense and many things. Now, this giant is planning to come into Indian ecommerce market. In India the ecommerce battle is already tensed enough with Flipkart, Amazon, eBay and other too. But now adding a new member may make it more intense.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per a report, <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/project-maven-google-ended-contract-pentagon-dod/" target="_blank">Google</a></span></strong></span> might come into the Indian market in this years ending. This launch might happen at end of the year or near Diwali. But a Google executive is seeing these reports as some speculation. In recent time Google has invested in JD.com, a Chinese ecommerce firm. The investment was of about $500M. Both companies are stating this deal just as a strategic partnership. Both have given statement about developing the market. Few time ago Walmart and JD.com have also gone under the same.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Caesar Sengupta, Leads product management in Google HQ, is testing India market. They want to be sure before making their appearance in the market. If everything goes as per their plan than India will be Google’s first customer in ecommerce business. Google is confident of huge benefits from its 18M email users and other subscribers. This big audience will help in purchasing power and choice of million users online.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Indian government’s <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>Economic Survey 2024</strong></span> revealed that India’s ecommerce <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>market reached $33B</strong></span> registering a <strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;">19.1% growth in 2016-2017</span></strong>.</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Also, there are some words like Google is going to make an investment of $1-2B into Flipkart via Walmart. Walmart has acquired 77% of Flipkart’s stacks with investing $16B. This big takeover of stacks are still being considered but the move played by Google is not much of a surprise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we go back to 2012, Google launched its Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF). This shopping event made its appearance in December 2012. This festival was discontinued in November 2015 due to growing ecommerce websites Flipkart and Amazon. GOSF was kind of foundation for the ecommerce players like Flipkart, Myntra and Snapdeal and other. With its advertising, Google is encouraging brick and mortar seller to get listed on Google. Google is extracting data from its different channel to come solid into the market at this time. Hope, we will see them sooner in the market.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Project-Maven.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4957" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Project-Maven.jpg" alt="Project Maven, Google, AI, Cloud, Pentagon, DoD" width="900" height="578" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Project-Maven.jpg 900w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Project-Maven-300x193.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Project-Maven-696x447.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Google-Project-Maven-654x420.jpg 654w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a>Google’s Employees were leaving their jobs as the Google had the contract with Pentagon/ DoD. Project Maven was the big issue here that was making the controversy. Google yesterday announced that there will be an end to this contract now. The current contract will end in 2019 with DoD and then it will not be renewed. As Gizmodo have noticed, the thing Google will release an update code of ethics. This reveal was due to the publication of information indicating that Google is more involved in the DoD projects by The Intercept.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Backlash shown by the Google employees was horrible and Google doesn’t want it. Google Cloud CEO, Diane Greene announced to meet employees on Friday Morning. Three sources told this to Gizmodo. In the time when Google was pursuing more in Military and Pentagon projects, they made this decision. Google will no longer be part of Project Maven. Google will create new ethical principal next week on the use of their AI. Google’s Spoke person did not respond to questions regarding this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Google made the decision to provide its AI to the military for analyzing images from the drone then Google employees started backlashing. They all signed a paper that was forcing Google to end the project Maven. Some of their employees have resigned from the job.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>&#8220;Project Maven made Google Employees to backlash or resing in protest.&#8221;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In meanwhile, Google defended its work on the project Maven. With its senior executives, they explained about their work in the Maven. Their work was simply to provide open-source software to the military and their work is so little in that. But as Gizmodo made more analysis of internal emails it shows that it executives viewed it as the golden opportunity for them. It will open doors for them to get more military projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Gizmodo, there were two sets of emails revealing that Google’s senior leadership was enthusiastically supportive of Project Maven. This was because it would set Google Cloud on the path to get large Pentagon contracts. But this also made them concern about how the company’s involvement would be perceived. Two emails also revealed that work on Maven faced some challenges. Google’s machine learning needs images from the drone to learn. But Govt. does not authorize this type of data to be held in their cloud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Google’s software or tools were not used in any warfare. They are only helping the military in analyzing the footage from drones. The focus of Project Maven was to detect civilian-friendly zones during the air-strike.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many companies are into AR technology but <span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/google-working-standalone-ar-glass-quanta-computer/">Google</a></strong></span> and <strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/microsoft-producing-ai-detect-and-eliminate-fake-news/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a></span></strong> are leaving everyone behind. What can you expect from these tech giants? In recent time there came a rumor that Google is again working on a smart glass that supports mixed reality. Now in these so many announcements, Microsoft made a big announcement. Microsoft has released 2 applications, Remote Assist and Layout with mixed reality. This is one big announcement in Build 2024 so far.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remote Assist is available on the Headset display “Hololens” and Layout can be used via the compatible system. A device with these applications must have the understanding of AR or Mixed Reality. Both these applications will be useful for “FirstLine” workers. Both works an instruction tool. Operator can give instruction to Headset wearer. The instruction will be displayed to person with headset. Instruction will appear in a 3D model mixed with the reality wearer is seeing.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>Microsoft Remote Assist and Microsoft Layout</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, both the apps are in preview mode. These apps appeared in Microsoft Store last week without any announcement. These apps come with a motive to make work easy for office. This way they can collaborate with their team members. Remote Assist can be used for hand free video calling with image sharing and mixed reality annotation to get hand free instructions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, Layout can work with the Hololens and as well as mixed reality compatible PC. This will show you 3D model in a room at real-world scale. You can see how an object is going to fit in. It is like a hologram of that object into virtual or physical reality. Microsoft is pushing both of these applications to make mixed reality a useful thing in daily life.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>What is Augmented Reality (AR)?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When computer-generated images are superimposed to the real world live view of a person, this is called AR. That enhances user’s perspective view. In simple words as virtual reality creates an entirely virtual environment to work with. But AR uses users live view (live real environment) and superimpose it with digital/ virtual information. It might not sound thrilling as VR-Roller Coaster ride but it is far better and useful than the VR. Its use in office, industry, and home is more than we can imagine.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Google has been already made some smart glasses before. There was a time when they had worked on Google Glass and Daydream headset. This time as they are working on another AR glass, code name “Google A65”. Before that <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #3366ff;"><strong><a style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #3366ff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/microsoft-producing-ai-detect-and-eliminate-fake-news/">Microsoft</a></strong></span> came with “HoloLens” in 2016. That was aimed at training, design and industrial uses. Now Google is collaborating with Quanta Computers Inc. to make this QUALCOMM based AR glasses. Quanta Computers is a Taiwan-based computer and electronic device manufacturer. They have also done a project together earlier, Pixel C tablet.</p>
<h2><strong>Features of Google AR Glass</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As per the different sources, it is said to be that it has many features. Like the headset will be based on ARM Cortex-A75. The headset is said to be available with Google Assistant to control it. It will have a camera sensor and microphone. Its processor will support 2560&#215;1440 (WQHD) resolution with 1080p and 1030p video support. The headset will have 3D overlay and rendering interface OpenGL, OpenCL, and Vulcan. All these with Gigabit wireless, Bluetooth 5.1 and GPS. The working would be so much similar to “Hololens”.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4913" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm.jpg" alt="Google, AR, Glass, HoloLens" width="1261" height="733" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm.jpg 1261w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm-300x174.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm-1024x595.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm-696x405.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm-1068x621.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Qualcomm-723x420.jpg 723w" sizes="(max-width: 1261px) 100vw, 1261px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the report “Qualcomm also places great emphasis on the processing of certain kinds of artificial intelligence data in the chip. So the chip contains a neural processing engine and is for use in conjunction with the Android Neural Networks API designed. An integrated LTE or even 5G modem is missing.” Google’s last AR glass received so much criticism. But last year they launched its enterprise version. Despite lie HoloLens, it is hard to say if it will support mixed reality.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">HoloLens make interaction with the reality and create a virtual object as part of the reality. This is what sometimes called mixed reality. The chipset of the headset already filled with an AI that is designed for IOT. Still, the headset is missing dedicated LTE or 5G modem. So it will depend upon the other devices to get access of the internet.</p>

Their event <span style="background-color: #33cccc; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/google-io-live-stream-what-expect-everything-you-need-know/" target="_blank">Google I/O</a></strong></span> is about start in 11 hours where people will have a glimpse of these apps. We know that machine learning is a basic element of many of the company nowadays. Google is training their system to recognize the pattern and adapt. This whole process is helping Google in correcting itself. Google has also explained how its various applications are using AI and machine learning.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Object Reading Machine Learning</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camera.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4888" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camera.jpg" alt="Machine Learning, Pixel 2, Google, AI, Artificial Intelligence" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camera.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camera-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camera-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/camera-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>One big example is the recent product of Pixel 2 and its camera. When you click a portrait image with it, it applies a ‘shallow depth effect’ in that. The camera app has an object detection that let it know where the object is and keep other things blurred. Now the click is done, the photo got saved in Google Photo. It uses the same object detection. Like which pic is of you, your friend or pet. It helps when you search for pets picture and it show you the perfect results.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Learning from Your Reply</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rply.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4895" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rply.jpg" alt="Machine Learning, Pixel 2, Google, AI, Artificial Intelligence" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rply.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rply-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rply-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/rply-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Another in this queue is Gmail and Google Allo. As you get into a conversion the AI will pop up reply suggestions for you. As the time passes it will start learning your reply to specific words. So next time if you get a text it will suggest you ‘near to right’ reply suggestion for that. Now, these replies are called smart replies.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Machine Learning in Music and Video</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Music_Video.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4894" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Music_Video.jpg" alt="Machine Learning, Pixel 2, Google, AI, Artificial Intelligence" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Music_Video.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Music_Video-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Music_Video-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Music_Video-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Google is into entertainment also. Its application Google Play Music also uses AI and Machine Learning. Whenever you browse or play some music more than others. It keeps their details saved in their system. These data help it in suggesting you the music of your taste. Same happens with YouTube. But YouTube also uses an automatic caption that use voice recognition pattern to create subtitle. So basically it changes audio to text. But also it keeps on learning new words.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Translator also use Machine Learning</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/translator.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4896 gr-progress" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/translator.jpg" alt="Machine Learning, Pixel 2, Google, AI, Artificial Intelligence" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/translator.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/translator-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/translator-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/translator-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Translator is one most popular and used application. It has a feature where you can scan text and translate it into some particular languages. Here the application uses optical recognition technology to detect the text present in the image. This optical character recognized compare this data with the Translators Data to give the right result.</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>What is Machine Learning?</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/machine-learning_Work.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4889" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/machine-learning_Work.jpg" alt="Machine Learning, Pixel 2, Google, AI, Artificial Intelligence" width="800" height="450" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/machine-learning_Work.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/machine-learning_Work-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/machine-learning_Work-696x392.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/machine-learning_Work-747x420.jpg 747w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>When software or system reads some patterns and recognizes those patterns for next usage it. Or you can <strong><span style="background-color: #33cccc; color: #ffffff;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/what-machine-learning-how-different-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">read our blog on this to learn about it more</a></span></strong>. But if we listen to Google Developers then Machine Learning is ‘Alchemy’. They said that it is hard to know why their code is working and why they are not.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Google, one of the tech giant, no one expect a tech festival from them but it organizes one. Yes, Google I/O is an event held each year for all the developers around the Globe. It is like a meeting with Googlers. They share their insight, knowledge and detail about their products. Just like the last year, it will take place at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. This is where Google gives a peak of its upcoming products, new updates and much more. So let&#8217;s list all the things that we can expect in Google I/O 2024.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #99cc00;"><strong>Android P</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4870" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p.jpg" alt="android P, flutter, google, io, chrome, fuchsia" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p-300x150.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/p-696x348.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another version of Google’s Android OS. The announcement of this new version was made in I/O 2017. But still, nothing is revealed that much. No one is much sure about what we are going to get in this latest update. Google Developers have not much revealed that much about it yet. But it is likely to say that it is going to make an appearance into this years event. According to ‘Engadget’ <span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #99cc00;"><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://developer.android.com/preview/" target="_blank">Android P</a></span></strong></span> will be having a gesture-based navigation system. But chances are that it is going to be pixel exclusive.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">W</span><span style="color: #ffcc00;">e</span><span style="color: #339966;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r</span> <span style="color: #339966;">O</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></strong></h1>
<p><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wear-OS1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4881" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wear-OS1.jpg" alt="android P, flutter, google, io, chrome, fuchsia" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wear-OS1.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wear-OS1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wear-OS1-696x348.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>
<p>We already talked about the Wear OS in our previous post. Google made the appearance of this product just a few days before their event is about to start. <strong><span style="background-color: #ff9900; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ff9900; color: #ffffff;" href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wear-os-updates-google-assistant/" target="_blank">Wear OS</a></span></strong> is just a new face of ‘Android Wear’. This renovation of the 4-year-old product is quite amazing. Now it will answer you back through watch speakers. Google has recently made big changes in it. They have increased the number of commands that it will perform now. Integration with the third-party application is also available.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #999999;">Chrome</span> <span style="color: #339966;">O</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span></strong></h1>
<p><a href="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chrome-OS.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4875" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chrome-OS.jpg" alt="android P, flutter, google, io, chrome, fuchsia" width="800" height="400" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chrome-OS.jpg 800w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chrome-OS-300x150.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chrome-OS-696x348.jpg 696w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Google has billions of user-centred Internet products. If we talk about the favourite browser-based OS then <strong><span style="background-color: #ff9900; color: #ffffff;"><a style="background-color: #ff9900; color: #ffffff;" href="https://google.com/chromebook/" target="_blank">Chrome OS</a></span></strong> is everyone’s choice here. From past few time Google’s developers were working on building Linux app compatibility in their OS. And now they have reached goal point. The compatibility is finally achieved. This news was made out by Chrome Unboxed. With this, it will be able to run with Linux tools, editors and IDE’s on Chromebooks. This will it a chance to replace current traditional OS.</p>

It is an AI that gives you answers for your queries. ‘Ok Google’ is much more famous today. Most people are using it as a source of entertainment but it is actually more than. It has millions of voice command that it can perform to make using mobile more convenient. It is getting more rounded now. But now from ‘Ok Google’, it is moving to ‘Hey Google’.</p>

Flutters is one new ecosystem that Google built but it is in beta version. Google will surely be keen to introduce more developers to it in I/O. Flutter is best for developing applications for iOS and Android. It comes with separate UI design framework for both platforms. This makes it easier to have material like design. Also Flutter is an application development for Google’s experimental OS Fuchsia.</p>

<p>A Google-branded Android TV stick has passed through the FCC, hinting that it might be unveiled soon. Although not confirmed, there’s a good chance it will make its debut at the I/O conference in May. Google’s stick will go head to head with products such as Amazon’s Fire TV. It should transform your dumb television into a smart one, giving you access to various streaming apps like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, and loads of others.</p>
<p>Google tends to thoroughly show off new hardware at a separate event later in the year, but the timing seems right for an announcement &#8212; after all, the company revealed its plans for standalone Daydream VR headsets last year, so talk of new devices isn&#8217;t exactly rare at I/O.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>Fuchsia</strong></span></h1>

If you still haven’t heard of it try to catch up fast. Google is been working on it from more than a year and it appeared in I/O 2017 too. Not sure if Google will introduce Fuchsia this year or not but we can still hope for good. It is said that it will be hybrid OS that will replace Chrome OS and Android OS. Ars Technica made a deep dive into this and said that this OS is barely functional right now.</p>
<h1><strong><span style="color: #99cc00;">Android</span> <span style="color: #808080;">Things</span></strong></h1>

<p>Android Things is closing in on prime time after Google released the final developer preview version of the platform last month. That was version eight for those keeping track. Given the timing and an event packed full of developers, it’s likely that we’ll see Android Things finally hit 1.0, a full two years after Google rebranded its IoT operation.</p>
<p>If you haven’t heard about it before, Android Things is Google’s platform to power smart home products, ranging from small IoT devices up to smart speakers and displays. Google says that the final version of Things will be based on Oreo and will power upcoming Smart Display devices powered by Google Assistant.</p>
<h1><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>* Live Streaming</strong></span></h1>
<p>No one wants to miss this opportunity to meet this much awesomeness in such short time period. But the problem is many of us can’t make it to California. Don’t worry Google has already thought of it. You can stream to it live from <span style="background-color: #ff9900; color: #ffffff;"><strong><a style="color: #ffffff;" href="https://events.google.com/io/" target="_blank">their website</a></strong></span> during the conference. Also, you can watch it later on Google Developers YouTube Channel. The whole session will be available for you on their channel that you can have access to any time.</p>
