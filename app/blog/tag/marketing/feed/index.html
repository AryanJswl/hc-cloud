Here main focus is not into making followers but making impression on people. But what about people with large number of followers?

It is also perceived as an endorsement of the brand by many potential buyers. And a large percentage of people trust influencers and online reviews as much as they would trust a friend&#8217;s advice.” says David Abehsera, President and Co-founder of The Woo.</p>
