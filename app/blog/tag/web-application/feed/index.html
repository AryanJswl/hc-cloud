<p><strong>Amazon Web Services Management Console&nbsp;</strong>is a&nbsp;<strong>web application</strong>&nbsp;that comprises and refers to a broad collection of service consoles for managing&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazon-web-services-and-their-products/" target="_blank"><strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Amazon Web Services</span></strong></a>.

For added security, your login session automatically expires after 12 hours. To resume your session, simply click the “Click login to continue” button and log in again. You can also set your own time limits on federated sessions, based on your organization’s preference, using the federation API (GetFederationToken or AssumeRole).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Browser support</strong></h2>



<p>Explore any AWS service with your choice of browsers. The Console supports the three latest versions of&nbsp;<strong>Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari</strong>&nbsp;as well as<strong>&nbsp;Microsoft Internet Explorer 11</strong>.</p>

Download the mobile app from&nbsp;<strong>Amazon Appstore</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;Google Play</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>iTunes</strong>.</p>



<p>Getting Started with&nbsp;<strong>AWS Management Console</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>AWS Management Console&nbsp;</strong>provides multiple ways for navigating to individual service consoles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>To open a console for a service</strong></h2>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about the how to create wireframes for your application. Wireframes are the base of any application. </p>



<p>Regardless of how excellent your idea for a&nbsp;mobile app&nbsp;is, if you don’t know where to start and how to go about it, it will fail. Our consistent response to such confusion is – wireframe!</p>



<p style="font-size:0"><strong><span style="color:#27aae2" class="has-inline-color">Wireframing</span></strong> is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on the way client want to see your application.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Does Wireframe Show?</h2>



<p>As mentioned above, it’s a two-dimensional skeleton of what your future mobile app will look like. It shows:</p>



<ul><li>Content prioritization</li><li>Space distribution</li><li>Intended actions</li><li>Available features and functions</li><li>Transitions between screens</li></ul>



<p><strong>Wireframes</strong> can drawn on paper, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your <strong>website or product</strong>. In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:</p>



<ul><li>Wireframe &gt; Interactive Prototype &gt; Visual &gt; Design</li><li>Sketch &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Hi-Def Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li><li>Sketch &gt; Wireframe &gt; Visual &gt; Code</li></ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Focus Integral Aspects of a Website</h2>



<p>In the beginning focus on integral aspects of a website. Firstly don’t even consider the design aesthetics for now. The colors, themes, fonts, and images can be taken care of later.</p>



<p>You must have a clear understanding of the features you need in your final product.&nbsp;Prepare a list and include all the things you actually need in your app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to aim at excellent user experience with your app. What’s the first thing users will see after launching your app? How will this screen guide them for further navigation? How can users take specific actions? Is it going to be easier for them to figure out?</p>



<p>UX can be abstract and complicated. Because, just like everything else on the Internet, the UX is also evolving at a tremendous pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Now you are ready to start putting these ideas down. </h2>



<p>You don&#8217;t need to use pen and paper to start designing your UX, UI when there are tonnes of applications available in the market which that you can easy build one for you. </p>



<p>Now before ending this I want to share some tools name that can be very useful for building wireframes.</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color"><strong>Balsmiq</strong>, <strong>draw.io</strong>, <strong>Sketch</strong>, <strong>Figma</strong> are the free tools available online. You can easily start working on these start putting your ideas and start building your application.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://ehorus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saas-solutions-featured.png"><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4661" src="https://ehorus.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/saas-solutions-featured.png" alt="saas" width="847" height="446" /></a>SaaS is “Software as a Service”. This is having the service of a software whenever you want. All you need is an internet connection with good speed. It will create an environment around you to use the software. This software is somewhere in the network. As you get the browser you will get software in your system. You can use it and as the browser gets close the software will no longer exist. No need to install anything.</p>
<h4>Example of SaaS:</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For a better explanation, let&#8217;s talk about Gmail. It is just a mail sending and receiving service. Gmail is gets its service from the cloud server. These clouds stores all the user data. Now as you access it, it generates its interference into the browser. Now you get logged in, or register, use their services and then leave. Gmail doesn’t need to any installation on your system to work well. All you do is accessing the website that is actually working as a software. The browser only played a role to provide that software a platform to run.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">How Can You Define SaaS?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">SaaS comes with many other names like web application, browser software, on-demand software and other. Not just Gmail, it can be delivered as management software, payment software, travel details or banking software or browser games. In any way that is possible and get delivered to you. SaaS is usually a paid service for its access. This is just to license the product usage. The owner can also cloak services and support with any component.</p>
<h4 style="text-align: justify;">Why is SaaS that important?</h4>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The biggest advantage it gives is of its usage. You don’t need to store software, install it or upgrading it. All of this hassle is taken care of when on the cloud. Software get its self update while it is in cloud. All you require is a browser and an Internet connection. No more need to maintain software or hardware for it. There are several kinds of premium pay of SaaS. In subscription-model, you pay depending on your usage. You will only pay for only what part you are using.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another good thing about them is they are flexible and scalable. Your work can rely on these software with full belief of growth. Also, it is platform independent. You can access your data and function whenever you want and however you want. Why? Because they only need an OS dependency. They can freely run this on their system by getting an Internet access and a browser.</p>
