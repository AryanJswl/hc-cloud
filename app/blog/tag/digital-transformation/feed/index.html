<p>In this blog, I am going to talk about What is Sales Funnel and Sales Model? How you can boost your business, reach to right audience, Generate Leads and definately make profits. So in today&#8217;s world everything is digitally available and Sales Funnel is a core concept of&nbsp;<strong>Digital Marketing</strong>. To be successful in this Digital world your business need to showcase the product and services you provide and how your business is unique, how you add value.</p>



<p>A sales funnel is a marketing concept that maps out the journey a customer goes through when making any kind of purchase. The model uses a funnel as an analogy because a large number of potential customers may begin at the top-end of the&nbsp;sales process, but only a fraction of these people actually end up making a purchase.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How you can Reach Right Audience for your Business?</h2>



<p>Reaching a right audience is first step to generate business for this you have to be very specific with your niche. To help you out with this<strong> HawksCode Software Pvt Ltd </strong>is working as a Digital Marketing company<strong> </strong>from past 8 years. Successfully boost their client business. Following are the clients who are satisfied with their work: </p>



<p>1. Australian Qualification Training (AQT),Australia</p>



<p>2. Amstore Innovation, London</p>



<p>3. Maccabiah Games, Israel</p>



<p>4. U.S. Census Bureau, USA</p>



<p>5. Grasshoper, Australia</p>



<p>6. Sunwave, New Zealand</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Sales Funnel is divided into multiple Steps</h2>



<p>Sales funnel is divided into multiple steps, which differ depending on the particular sales model. One of the most common ways of dividing a sales funnel possesses seven phases including:</p>



<p><strong>Awareness Phase</strong> Inn which prospects become aware of the existence of a solution.</p>



<p><strong>Interest Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects demonstrate interest in a product by conducting product research.</p>



<p><strong>Evaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which prospects or prospect companies examine competitors’ solutions as they inch toward a final buying decision.</p>



<p><strong>Decision Phase</strong>&nbsp;– In which a final decision is reached and negotiation begins.</p>



<p><strong>Purchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which goods or services are purchased.</p>



<p><strong>Reevaluation Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in B2B sales it’s common for offerings to involve contracts that need to be renewed. As a customer becomes familiar with an offering, and especially as a contract draws to a close, a customer will enter a reevaluation phase during which they’ll decide whether or not to renew their contract.</p>



<p><strong>Repurchase Phase</strong>&nbsp;– in which a customer repurchases a product or service.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Optimizing each Stage of sales process</h2>



<p>Optimizing your website, facebook ads, sales funnel plays an important role to increase traffic, leads and Both marketing teams and inside sales managers commonly adopt strategies, tools, and tactics aimed at optimizing each stage of their sales process.  To reach out the audience you need right tools for it and a right Digital Marketing team who can help you out with this. </p>

<p>In this blog, I will discuss about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>. Imagine your computer could think like you do or even understand you? That future may not be now, but it’s one step closer, thanks to scientists and engineers and their recent discovery of a materials-based mimic for the neural signals responsible for transmitting information within the human brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus</h2>



<p>We are very closer to this reality where material that will change with temperature or an electrical stimulus. The team was able to clarify the mechanism driving this behavior by taking a new look at&nbsp;<strong>β’-CuxV2O5</strong>. A chameleon-like material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus. In the process, they zeroed in on how copper ions move around inside the material and how this subtle dance in turn sloshes electrons around to transform it.</p>



<p>Their research revealed that the movement of copper ions is the linchpin of an electrical conductivity change which can be leveraged to create electrical spikes in the same way that neurons function in the cerebral nervous system. <strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Material</h2>



<p>“Nature has given us materials with the appropriate types of behavior to mimic the information processing that occurs in a brain, but the ones characterized to date have had various limitations,”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of this work is to show that&nbsp;<strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong>&nbsp;and create electrically active materials with significantly improved neuromorphic properties. As we understand more, our materials will improve significantly, thus providing a new path to the continual technological advancement of our computing abilities.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer build a mimic</h2>



<p>A computer built to mimic the brain’s neural networks produces similar results to that of the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movement of Copper ions</h2>



<p>A very small movement of copper ions within the structure brings about a massive change in conductance in the whole material. Because of this movement of copper ions, the material transforms from insulating to conducting in response to external changes in temperature, applied voltage or applied current. There is a huge gap between the energy consumption of the brain and today’s supercomputers. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing allows us to investigate how close we can get to the energy efficiency of the brain using electronics.”</p>

From those factors, one was business growth. 40% of the CEO or leaders are majorly focused on the business growth. Hiring employees with simple means of increasing productivity with undertaking digital transformation. Digital transformation is one way to make changes and upgrades in the structure of the company. This practice is upskilling the business and its entity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AI, Machine Learning and Predictive Analytics, these three elements of fourth industrial revolution has made businesses to undergo some changes. These changes are the first key to unlock door towards the transformation of culture. To be competitive in the market business must implement new emerging technology into their culture. Transformation is necessary and you can&#8217;t implement it in just snap of fingers. This slow process will keep you ahead of your competitors. Through these programs, CEOs reported achieving the ideal balance of skill upgradation, work-culture transformation and overall business optimization.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CIO and CEO with Digital Transformation for Business:</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Be a Leader:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to business, many CEOs see their business as an innovation pioneer. Here CIOs come into the role by encouraging their CEOs to invest more in R&amp;D. CIOs want their company to adopt digitization and make their products more innovative. The desire of being seen is making CIOs leaders in many areas of the company decisions. Even mergers, partnerships are also treated as ‘surgical integration’. Their faith is now more on employee’s experience because their experience helps in attaining comprehensive leadership.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Discuss the Budget:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Digital abilities are now taking over the center stage and that need all CEO’s to think like CIOs. This is crucial in a matter of budget allocation, resources acquisition. Digitization has played important role in growing businesses and keeping them ahead. However, a CEO must verify and do some digging about the technology they are about to implement in their business. So before undergoing any significant transformation CEO must do some practices. These are like, evaluation of financial impact, in-depth research of business need and values addition toward business.</p>
