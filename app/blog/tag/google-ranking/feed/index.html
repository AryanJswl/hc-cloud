But as of Google 2019 rule for the search result has been made some points clear we can think that there are many points those will affect your website’s rank in a different manner.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Google Improving Its Algo For Ranking:</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google has been improving its search engine, the number of details on your website that Google’s algorithm looks at has grown substantially. These details include the text and some of the dangling threads of information used to program your site.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Great amounts of research have been conducted to determine what these factors are and to what extent Google places value on each element. The results are ultimately educated guesses at best.  Google tells the world very little about how it ranks websites, at least not directly.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How Does Google Ranking Work in 2019?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google uses a variety of factors in its algorithm to determine what results will be the most helpful for the user. It also uses latent semantic indexing, which uses search intent as an indicator of what results are the most relevant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Google built its current algorithm around RankBrain, a machine learning (AI) algorithm Google uses to help sort and improve the search results. Backlinko condensed it pretty well:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">In short, RankBrain tweaks the algorithm on its own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Depending on the keyword, RankBrain will increase or decrease the importance of backlinks, content freshness, content length, domain authority, etc. Then, it looks at how Google searchers interact with new search results. If users like the new algorithm better, it stays. If not, RankBrain rolls back the old algorithm.</span></p>
<p><figure id="attachment_5404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-5404" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="wp-image-5404 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png" alt="How Web Desing can Affect Your Search Engine Ranking" width="1024" height="387" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-300x113.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-768x290.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/How-Web-Desing-can-Affect-Your-Search-Engine-Ranking-696x263.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-5404" class="wp-caption-text">Image Credit: Backlinko</figcaption></figure></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">The reason for this is because one search term can have hundreds of meanings. For example, if I conduct a search for the word “bathroom,” Google has no idea of what I’m really looking for. Possible results could range wildly, including:</span></p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Finding the nearest public restroom</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 12pt;">Defining what a bathroom is</span></li>

<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Bad design will hurt your SEO</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Someone goes online and searches for an answer, a service, or a product, and it leads them to your website. Sweet!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>…But</strong> <strong>suppose</strong> they choose not to engage with your content because of poor design. It’s too hard to read, too ugly, too complicated. They’ll return to the SERP (Search Engine Results Page) to find a better answer to their query.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Pop-ups:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">Pop-ups can be useful, but serve as a pain point for your online audience, especially if they haven’t accessed any of your content yet. Use them sparingly, and not as soon as someone arrives at your site. Generally, you need to build trust with your audience before making an ask for their contact information or a commitment like subscription sign up.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Illegible text:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 14pt;">If you’ve chosen a font that is too small, too hard to read, or is presented as part of an offensive color scheme, people will not stick around to decipher your messaging. Using a readability tool will help you ensure that your text is always a delight for your visitors to read.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Loud sounds:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif; font-size: 18.6667px;">You should never make audio tracks or video play automatically on your website. If you do have a clip playing automatically, ensure that it&#8217;s muted.</span></p>
