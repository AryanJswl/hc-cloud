<p>In today’s blog, I am going to talk about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech&nbsp;innovation.&nbsp;</strong></strong>Reading the ebullient reports, you’d be hard-pressed to find anything other than overflowing optimism for how technology will transform our lives. And admittedly, it’s hard to imagine how&nbsp;smart shoes&nbsp;or a rollable TV screen&nbsp;could possibly be bad for us. From virtual reality so “there” you can almost touch it, to the Internet of every imaginable thing, we’re being dazzled by the seemingly infinite possibilities that modern tech has to offer. To learn this in detail watch this video&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=K-iAkaMWx-U" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Thinking innovatively about the risks of tech innovation.</span></a></strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>All technologies come with risks</strong></h2>



<p>With the uncritical enthusiasm around CES, it’s easy to ignore the potential consequences of irresponsible technology innovation. It’s even easier to turn a blind eye to the challenges we face in developing technologies that are good for society as a whole, and don’t just enrich those who create them.</p>



<p>Take for example&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/amazing-humanoid-robots/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">robotics</span></a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/tag/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">artificial intelligence (AI)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.easyshiksha.com/what-is-internet-of-things/" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</span></a></strong>&nbsp;– three trends that were amply represented at the show. While each holds the potential to profoundly change our lives for the better, these technologies are by no stretch of the imagination intrinsically safe. Fears over the consequences of irresponsible AI development have already been widely voiced, and the rapid rise of the Internet of Things threatens to make everyday objects&nbsp;vulnerable to cyber attacks. And all three have the potential to widen the gap between the privileged and the disadvantaged.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do we rethink risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Here in the Arizona State University&nbsp;<strong>Risk Innovation Lab</strong>, we’re developing a new approach to risk that is designed to open up new ideas and possibilities. We call it&nbsp;Risk Innovation.This in itself is an innovative way of thinking about risk. It opens up new ways of imagining the risk landscapes that new technologies both face and help to form.To me, it’s the individuals, communities and organizations – the constituents – who have something of tangible value that is potentially threatened, and that they are willing to invest in protecting.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-1024x576.png" alt="AI based Video Analytics Making Supply Chains Smarter" class="wp-image-5765" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-300x169.png 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-768x432.png 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-696x391.png 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-1068x600.png 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim-747x420.png 747w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/imgpsh_fullsize_anim.png 1366w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong>AI based Video Analytics Making Supply Chains Smarter</strong>. The growing use of <a href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School"><strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong></a>-powered video analytics over the years has radically altered and improved the operations of many processes, across industries and continents. The findings of the IHS Markit Video Surveillance Intelligence Service shows that there has been a consistent growth in the global professional video surveillance equipment market, with the worldwide market revenue jumping up from $18.2 billion in 2024 to $19.9 billion in 2019.</p>



<p>Moreover, the use of video is becoming vital for businesses to ensure better management of their inventory. There are often instances of damage, theft or pilferage of goods, either when they are in the warehouse or in transit. To overcome these challenges, CCTV cameras backed with video analytics are being employed, which can efficiently and instantly track and detect any kind of suspicious activity and further send alerts to the server over the network. The supply chain managers are then able to take prompt action to ensure uninterrupted supply of the products.</p>



<p>At present, when COVID-19 has brought about ripples of turbulence for almost all businesses, requiring them to practice and adopt enhanced safety measures, video analytics has truly been playing a quintessential role by ensuring that all safety precautions are being duly undertaken to limit the spread of infection. The CCTV cameras equipped with video analytics are able to closely monitor the movement of people, making sure that social distancing norms are strictly followed and face masks are mandatorily used. In case of any violation of any of these norms, the system automatically triggers alerts, which allows for appropriate action to be taken.</p>



<p>Further, while during road transport, when goods are transported in bulk from one place to another, the use of video analytics makes it possible for businesses to analyse the truck utilization patterns on a daily basis and gain a view of loading/unloading activity details, load per cent capacity, etc. This aids the supply chain managers to keep a check on the overall productivity of their fleet, and make changes whenever necessary. Also, there are other KPIs like facial recognition, driver wellness, etc., that can be efficiently monitored to ensure control and optimization of the supply chain.</p>



<p>Needless to say, advances in technology have paved the way for many exciting opportunities for businesses. Besides bringing in visibility and transparency, video analytics has proved extremely helpful in ensuring safety, quality, timeliness, performance and productivity for businesses. By seamlessly integrating with the existing video infrastructure, the technology has been successful in increasing the supply chain efficiency, eventually translating into increased customer satisfaction and improved business profits.&nbsp; Isn’t this disruptive? Yes, it certainly is!</p>

<p>In this blog, I will discuss about&nbsp;<strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>. Imagine your computer could think like you do or even understand you? That future may not be now, but it’s one step closer, thanks to scientists and engineers and their recent discovery of a materials-based mimic for the neural signals responsible for transmitting information within the human brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus</h2>



<p>We are very closer to this reality where material that will change with temperature or an electrical stimulus. The team was able to clarify the mechanism driving this behavior by taking a new look at&nbsp;<strong>β’-CuxV2O5</strong>. A chameleon-like material that changes with temperature or an applied electrical stimulus. In the process, they zeroed in on how copper ions move around inside the material and how this subtle dance in turn sloshes electrons around to transform it.</p>



<p>Their research revealed that the movement of copper ions is the linchpin of an electrical conductivity change which can be leveraged to create electrical spikes in the same way that neurons function in the cerebral nervous system. <strong><strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong></strong>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Natural Material</h2>



<p>“Nature has given us materials with the appropriate types of behavior to mimic the information processing that occurs in a brain, but the ones characterized to date have had various limitations,”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The importance of this work is to show that&nbsp;<strong>Design of inorganic material for brain like computing</strong>&nbsp;and create electrically active materials with significantly improved neuromorphic properties. As we understand more, our materials will improve significantly, thus providing a new path to the continual technological advancement of our computing abilities.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Computer build a mimic</h2>



<p>A computer built to mimic the brain’s neural networks produces similar results to that of the best brain-simulation supercomputer software currently used for neural-signaling research.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Movement of Copper ions</h2>



<p>A very small movement of copper ions within the structure brings about a massive change in conductance in the whole material. Because of this movement of copper ions, the material transforms from insulating to conducting in response to external changes in temperature, applied voltage or applied current. There is a huge gap between the energy consumption of the brain and today’s supercomputers. Neuromorphic (brain-inspired) computing allows us to investigate how close we can get to the energy efficiency of the brain using electronics.”</p>

<p>In this blog,&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence</strong>. IN SILICON VALLEY,&nbsp;the new currency is artificial intelligence.Over the last few years, a&nbsp;technology called deep learning&nbsp;has proven so adept at identifying images, recognizing spoken words, and translating from one language to another, the titans of Silicon Valley are eager to push the state of the art even further—and push it quickly. The two biggest players are, yes, Google and Facebook.</p>



<p>It’s a big move, because while software platforms can certain make AI research easier, more replicable, and more shareable, the whole process is nearly impossible without powerful computers.&nbsp;<strong>Facebook Open-Sources The Computers Behind Its Artificial Intelligence.</strong> If you want to learn more about Artificial Intelligence concept visit <strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://easyshiksha.com/online_courses/Artificial-Intelligence-Provided-By-FinTech-School" target="_blank"><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-purple-color">Easyshiksha</span></a></strong><span class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">.</span></p>



<p>At Google, this tech not only helps the company&nbsp;recognize the commands you bark into your Android phone&nbsp;and&nbsp;instantly translate foreign street signs when you turn your phone their way.&nbsp;Regularly working with images or audio takes can be taxing for consumer-grade equipment, and some types of artificial intelligence have to break down and learn from 10 million pictures in order to learn from them. The process, called training, requires serious computing power.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">This is how the modern tech world works.&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Internet’s largest services typically run on open source software. “Open source is the currency of developers now,” says Sean Stephens, the CEO of a software company called Perfect. “It’s how they share their thoughts and ideas. In the closed source world, developers don’t have a lot of room to move.” And as these services shift to&nbsp;a new breed of streamlined hardware better suited to running enormous operations, many companies are sharing their hardware designs as well.</p>

<p>In this blog, we are going to discuss about Will robots and AI take our jobs in covid-19’s socially distanced era? Coronavirus has put a rocket below plans for extra automation, roboticisation and use of AI. Ought to we worry for our jobs – or will we simply get higher ones?</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) will have a fundamental impact on the global labour market in the next few years. Therefore, the authors discuss legal, economic and business issues, such as changes in the future labour market and in company structures, impact on working time, remuneration and on the working environment, new forms of employment and the impact on labour relations.</p>



<p>At many places you can see clothing store, bathing the window display in searing light. No alarm bells sound, no security guards rush forth. The Sunburst<strong> UV Bot, with its 1000 watts’ </strong>worth of UVC light capable of “tearing apart strands of virus DNA”, comes here every night, as well as to a few other<strong> malls and hospitals in Singapore</strong>. It is doing something that human workers would have done before the covid-19 pandemic: cleaning.</p>



<p>Similar scenes are occurring across the world. In Texan hospitals, Moxi delivers medications, lab samples and supplies. P Guard enforces lockdown curfews on Tunisian streets. James the telepresence bot helps residents at Belgian care homes stay connected. Other robots scrub supermarket floors, deliver meals to people in quarantine and even help walk the dog. Meanwhile, non-embodied artificial intelligences are assisting in everything from contact tracing and cracking the coronavirus’s genetic code to the logistics and customer fulfilment of an increasingly online commercial world.</p>



<p>This trend towards automation and roboticisation isn’t new – but covid-19 is vastly accelerating it. “What this pandemic has done is make people extremely aware of hygiene and the need to distance”, says Richard Pak at Clemson University in South Carolina. “In these times, robots and automation definitely provide a safety benefit.”</p>



<p>And perhaps also a huge problem. Unemployment has shot up as coronavirus has hit the global economy. What happens if we emerge from the covid-19 recession to find that jobs have permanently gone – with no plan B to keep us gainfully employed?</p>



<p>So is there any solution to this problem is Robot is going to capture the market which will lead to unemployment. But yes in today&#8217;s time it is difficult to get a robot for petty works because it&#8217;s costing is too high but yes in future we are going to totally rely on robots for petty work also.</p>

For this purpose, Facebook bought Bloomsbury, a London based AI startup which is specialized in developing and extending machine learning and natural language processing methods. According to Tech Crunch (Tech News Website), Facebook has spent 23 to 30 million dollars to buy Bloomsbury.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How can an AI solve this problem?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5143" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Solve-AI-and-Facebook-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />A very high percentage of people get news from Facebook and (Google-owned) YouTube and both of these major platforms are having troubles with handling the fake news. AI systems can evaluate how well a post’s text or a headline compares with the actual content of an article someone is sharing online. Another side AI systems can compare fake material to identified specific accounts, profiles or source websites. This can help a large number of people to avoid fake content and getting the real fact.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why Facebook need an AI?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-5144 size-full" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-AI-and-Facebook-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Facebook has a division named FAIR (Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research) which is working on AI for better user experience. The main goal to have an AI is to improve natural language processing and preventing inappropriate content on  Facebook, Instagram, and its many other properties. Many times facebook acknowledged that with more than 2 billion active users it’s not an easy task to prevent fake news or material that violates Facebook rules. That’s why Facebook decided to acquire Bloomsbury.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What can Bloomsbury do for Facebook?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5141" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloomsbury-AI-UK-London-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />Bloomsbury is a British startup company that building an AI that reads text documents and answers questions about the content. In a simple way, this British company can help Facebook to further understand natural language processing and its applications. Earlier Bloomsbury co-founder Sebastian Reidel also helped to create a fake news investigator AI Factmata which can tackle misleading content on the web. So we can say that Bloomsbury is a Triumph card for Facebook to combat against content problems.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Other legend tech company’s Contribution in this Campaign</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5142" src="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI.jpg" alt="facebook, bloomsbury, AI, Artificial Intelligence," width="1250" height="460" srcset="https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI.jpg 1250w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-300x110.jpg 300w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-768x283.jpg 768w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1024x377.jpg 1024w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-696x256.jpg 696w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1068x393.jpg 1068w, https://hawkscode.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Facebook-Contribution-in-AI-1141x420.jpg 1141w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" />The problems Facebook and Youtube are facing with fake news have alerted other tech companies and Microsoft is also trying to build trusted algorithms and stop false news. Microsoft wants that AI systems are needed to built in to augment human capabilities.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Otherwise, human intelligence is the real key to resolve this issue. It’s important that when somebody sees a violent or inappropriate content then that person should investigate the information, not sharing that immediately. Facebook and other companies are doing their best but users should be sensible and wise about this problem.</p>

Project Maven was the big issue here that was making the controversy. Google yesterday announced that there will be an end to this contract now. The current contract will end in 2019 with DoD and then it will not be renewed. As Gizmodo have noticed, the thing Google will release an update code of ethics. This reveal was due to the publication of information indicating that Google is more involved in the DoD projects by The Intercept.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Backlash shown by the Google employees was horrible and Google doesn’t want it. Google Cloud CEO, Diane Greene announced to meet employees on Friday Morning. Three sources told this to Gizmodo. In the time when Google was pursuing more in Military and Pentagon projects, they made this decision. Google will no longer be part of Project Maven. Google will create new ethical principal next week on the use of their AI. Google’s Spoke person did not respond to questions regarding this.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When Google made the decision to provide its AI to the military for analyzing images from the drone then Google employees started backlashing. They all signed a paper that was forcing Google to end the project Maven. Some of their employees have resigned from the job.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;"><strong>&#8220;Project Maven made Google Employees to backlash or resing in protest.&#8221;</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In meanwhile, Google defended its work on the project Maven. With its senior executives, they explained about their work in the Maven. Their work was simply to provide open-source software to the military and their work is so little in that. But as Gizmodo made more analysis of internal emails it shows that it executives viewed it as the golden opportunity for them. It will open doors for them to get more military projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">According to Gizmodo, there were two sets of emails revealing that Google’s senior leadership was enthusiastically supportive of Project Maven. This was because it would set Google Cloud on the path to get large Pentagon contracts. But this also made them concern about how the company’s involvement would be perceived. Two emails also revealed that work on Maven faced some challenges. Google’s machine learning needs images from the drone to learn. But Govt. does not authorize this type of data to be held in their cloud.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Although Google’s software or tools were not used in any warfare. They are only helping the military in analyzing the footage from drones. The focus of Project Maven was to detect civilian-friendly zones during the air-strike.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Recently Facebook has found a new problem in their system that is live streaming of violent videos by users. People are using this feature in a very bad and nasty way. Facebook tried to work out on this with other online live streaming platforms. Then in recent day, Facebook decided to design its own chip with a self-learning AI to stop steaming of these violent videos. FB users live streamed murder, violent act and even suicide. That made the website’s this feature so much infamous. These are the most disgusting imaginable for anyone but still, people are using it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As to the solution of this problem Facebook came with a combination of AI system and human moderators. They will keep these video off the grid and AI will keep learning about it. No matter how much AI will learn but the human moderator will still keep its work going on. Facebook first tried to make this flagging-algo with other online platforms but now Facebook is developing its own AI hardware.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><span style="background-color: #3366ff;">But why a Chip to filter Live Steam Video with AI?</span></strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A hardware chip will make the system to use less computing power. That will significantly increase the faster algorithm execution. Looks like Facebook is making a good investment by making this AI chip. AI will be helped whole time by a human moderator. This AI will take 10 minutes to bring down any violent video. Some video may stay live for up to an hour but AI will find it and bring it down. Facebook will not just clear their name but they also will make it family-friendly again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the tool will improvise with the time then it will help society so much. As the serial-killers will have no audience then they might stop committing murder or perpetrators will stop doing suicides. These disgusting acts from these mentally sick people will fade with time. As the murderer will no longer be glorified there will be no reason for them to live stream.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">But in what way Facebook will train its new AI is still a secret. How it is going to flag videos is unknown. Like the case happen back in 2017 when a police officer shot and killed Philando Castile. His GF streamed the whole incident on Facebook live. Facebook got confused with the situation and first deleted the video as a violent video. Then Facebook undid that and uploaded video back with the graphical content warning. After that Facebook again deleted the whole video ultimately. Facebook’s logic here was, the video about violence will be allowed only if it is raising awareness not celebrating it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So, in theory, it might be possible that the new AI chip will remove every video that is related to violence. It will not matter is it is celebrated or not.</p>
