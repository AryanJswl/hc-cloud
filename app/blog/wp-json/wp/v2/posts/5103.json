We know how big this name is and it has its foot in many regions like job guide, music, AI, US Department of Defense and many things. Now, this giant is planning to come into Indian ecommerce market. In India the ecommerce battle is already tensed enough with Flipkart, Amazon, eBay and other too. But now adding a new member may make it more intense.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As per a report, <span style=\"color: #ffffff;\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffcc00;\"><a style=\"color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/hawks-code.com\/blog\/project-maven-google-ended-contract-pentagon-dod\/\" target=\"_blank\">Google<\/a><\/span><\/strong><\/span> might come into the Indian market in this years ending. This launch might happen at end of the year or near Diwali. But a Google executive is seeing these reports as some speculation. In recent time Google has invested in JD.com, a Chinese ecommerce firm. The investment was of about $500M. Both companies\u00a0are stating this deal just as a strategic partnership. Both have given statement about developing the market. Few time ago Walmart and JD.com have also gone under the same.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Caesar Sengupta, Leads product management in Google HQ, is testing India market. They want to be sure before making their appearance in the market. If everything goes as per their plan than India will be Google\u2019s first customer in ecommerce business. Google is confident of huge benefits from its 18M email users and other subscribers. This big audience will help in purchasing power and choice of million users online.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Indian government\u2019s <span style=\"background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;\"><strong>Economic Survey 2018<\/strong><\/span> revealed that India\u2019s ecommerce <span style=\"background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;\"><strong>market reached $33B<\/strong><\/span> registering a <strong><span style=\"background-color: #3366ff; color: #ffffff;\">19.1% growth in 2016-2017<\/span><\/strong>.<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Also, there are some words like Google is going to make an investment of $1-2B into Flipkart via Walmart. Walmart has acquired 77% of Flipkart\u2019s stacks with investing $16B. This big takeover of stacks are still being considered but the move played by Google is not much of a surprise.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If we go back to 2012, Google launched its Great Online Shopping Festival (GOSF). This shopping event made its appearance in December 2012. This festival was discontinued in November 2015 due to growing ecommerce websites Flipkart and Amazon. GOSF was kind of foundation for the ecommerce players like Flipkart, Myntra and Snapdeal and other. With its advertising, Google is encouraging brick and mortar seller to get listed on Google. Google is extracting data from its different channel to come solid into the market at this time. Hope, we will see them sooner in the market.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everyone knows Google.
